Executive Summary
Introduction
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead,
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied
facilities (COFs). 1 The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692)
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has
been found to create lead hazards. Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint,
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed.
The 2008 LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
The proposed rule contains two major revisions to the LRRP program. The first revision is the removal
of the opt-out provision in 40 CFR §745.82(c), under which renovators do not need to follow the work
practices in the LRRP rule if they obtain a signed statement from the owner of a target housing unit
agreeing that the required LRRP work practices will not be used and stating that the renovation will occur
in the owner’s residence, no child under age 6 or pregnant woman resides there, and the housing is not a
COF. The second revision is a requirement that renovation firms provide owners and occupants with a
copy of the records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the
LRRP rule (referred to here as the “recordkeeping checklist requirement”).
Disturbing lead-based paint in renovation, repair, and painting events generates lead dust that is an
important source of lead exposure. Exposure to lead results in increased blood lead levels associated with
various adverse health effects. If EPA were to take no action, society would not incur the costs to comply
with the proposed rule, but the negative health and environmental effects due to these preventable lead
exposures would continue.
Number of Facilities Subject to the Rule
Table ES-1 provides summary information about the numbers of structures affected by the rule’s
requirements. There are 78 million target housing units and COFs, composed of 77.9 million target
housing units and 0.1 million COFs in public or commercial buildings. The 2008 LRRP rule applied to
37.7 million target housing units and 0.1 million public and commercial buildings. About 40.2 million
1 Target housing is defined as any housing constructed before 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities
(unless any child under age 6 resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling. A COF is
defined as a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, visited regularly by the same child, under 6 years
of age, on at least two different days within any week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that each day’s visit lasts
at least 3 hours and the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the combined annual visits last at least 60 hours.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-2
target housing units would be added to the regulated universe due to the elimination of the opt-out
provision. The recordkeeping checklist provision of the proposed rule would apply to all 78 million
target housing units and COFs.

Target housing: Owner-occupied housing where no child <age 6

COF in target housing, or a child <age 6 or pregnant woman
resides in housing X 37,665,000
Subtotal – all target housing 77,888,000
COFs in public or commercial - covered by 2008 LRRP rule X 97,000
Total 77,985,000
Note: Number of structures includes buildings with and without lead-based paint.
Estimated number of structures affected by the removal of the opt-out provision assumes that all owners of target
housing eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule would have chosen to opt-out.
Rule Options Analyzed
This economic analysis considers a variety of options for addressing the risks created by renovation,
repair, and painting (RRP) activities disturbing lead-based paint in housing previously eligible for the opt-
out provision. These options include different alternatives for the effective date of the rule; an option
phasing out the opt-out provision depending on when the housing was built; and different options for the
work practices requirements.
Options A through D all apply the 2008 LRRP requirements to renovations in the housing previously
eligible for the opt-out provision. However, the date when the opt-out provision would be eliminated
differs across options A through D. Options E1 through E4 all have the same effective date, but have
varying work practice requirements. Table ES-2 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they
are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both start eliminating the opt-out provision in June 2010, but Option A removes it for all
houses in June 2010 while Option D allows the owners of houses built between 1960 and 1978 to
continue to opt out until June 2011. Options B and C have effective dates of January 2011 and June 2011
(respectively) for the complete elimination of the opt-out provision.
Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of regulated structures as Option A,
but include alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same containment requirements as
the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning verification work practices. Option E2
has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not include
any containment work practices. Option E3 has the same cleaning requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule,
but does not include any containment or cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same
containment, cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not restrict
or prohibit any paint removal practices.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-3
All the options would also require renovation firms to provide owners and occupants of the buildings with
a copy of the records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the
LRRP rule. The effective date for the recordkeeping checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options.

*The effective date for the recordkeeping checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options.
Costs
The costs associated with the revisions to the §402(c) LRRP Rule are divided into four categories: (1)
work practice costs, (2) training costs, (3) certification costs (which include the firm’s paperwork burden
and EPA administrative and enforcement costs), and (4) recordkeeping checklist provision costs.2 The
costs associated with the first three components are all attributable to the elimination of the opt-out
provision, which will extend the 2008 LRRP rule requirements to additional housing units. In addition to
the work practice costs associated with the RRP events in these housing units, this change is predicted to
result in more individuals and firms seeking training and certification.3 The fourth component,
recordkeeping checklist provision costs, applies to all renovations regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule as
well as the additional housing units that would no longer be eligible for the opt-out provision.
2 Note that the costs of the proposed action as estimated in the Economic Analysis are expressed in 2005 dollars. The estimated
costs would be approximately 10 percent higher if they were adjusted to be expressed in 2009$.
3 This analysis assumes that renovation firms are somewhat specialized in terms of whether they work in facilities where the RRP
program is applicable. However, there may be many instances where firms working in opt-out housing will already have
become certified, and their staff been trained, because they also work in regulated facilities ineligible for the opt-out
provision. If firms are less specialized than the analysis assumed, there may be little to no incremental training and
certification costs due to the proposed rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-4
Costs are driven, in part, by the additional number of renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) events where
renovators test for lead-based paint once the opt-out provision is removed; and the subset of these events
that test positive for lead-based paint and where RRP is performed using the lead-safe cleaning,
containment, and verification practices required by the rule (referred to as lead-safe work practice events).
The number of events under each option is summarized in Table ES-3 and is compared with the number
of events regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule. The differences in the number of events in the first year
for options A through D are due to variation in the date the opt-out provision is eliminated, so the
differences in the costs estimated for Options A through D are all due to the timing of the opt-out
elimination. And since Options A and E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of
regulated structures, the cost differences among these options are all attributable to their different work
practice costs.
Because not all buildings built before 1978 have lead-based paint, the number of renovation events that
need to use lead safe work practices (LSWP) is a subset of the total number of events covered by the rule.
Currently available test kits for detecting whether lead-based paint is present have a high false positive
rate resulting in the frequent use of lead safe work practices when they are not necessary, i.e., when lead-
based paint is not present. EPA is working on the development of test kits that accurately identify both
the presence and absence of lead in paint at levels that exceed the Federal standards. This analysis
assumes that improved test kits will be in use starting in June 2011. Thus, the number of events with lead
safe work practices is estimated to decrease from the first year to the second year because of the adoption
of the improved test kits.

Table ES-4 indicates the component costs that comprise the total cost for Option A. Work practice costs
in housing formerly eligible for the opt-out provision represents the largest share of total costs of the
proposed rule.

Total $507 $279 $260 $320
In addition to the number of renovation events complying with the rule, other major factors in
determining the costs of the rule revisions are the additional number of firms certified and the additional
number of renovators and workers trained. The elimination of the opt-out provision is predicted to result
in more individuals and firms seeking training and certification in order to meet the increased demand for
RRP performed by certified firms and trained renovators resulting from the increase in the number of
events where it will be required. Each renovation project covered by the LRRP rule must be performed
by a certified firm and the work must be performed and/or directed by an individual who has become a
certified renovator by successfully completing renovator training from an accredited training provider.
The renovation activities may be performed by workers who have been provided on-the-job training by a
certified renovator. However, the certified renovator must be physically present at the work site while
signs are being posted, containment is being established, and the work area is being cleaned after the
renovation to ensure that these tasks are performed correctly.
Table ES-5 presents a summary of the estimated increase in the number of establishments that will seek
firm certification each year as a result of the removal of the opt-out provision, as well as the increase in
the estimated number of employees that will need to be trained as renovators and workers in the first three
years, and compares this to prior estimates for the 2008 LRRP rule.

Results for the proposed rule options only include the events affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision. These numbers
are incremental to the estimates for the 2008 LRRP rule (in the shaded row).
Analysis assumes a 75% compliance rate with the rule.
The estimates presented in Table ES-5 reflect the simplifying assumption that additional initial
certification and training due to the removal of the opt-out provision takes place over a 12 month period
starting from the effective date. For example, it is estimated that an additional 127 thousand trained
renovators would be necessary to meet the increased demand after the elimination of the opt-out
provision, so under Option A all 127 thousand are assumed to be trained from June 2010 through June
2011. Under Option B, the opt-out provision is eliminated half-way through the first year (January 2011).
Thus, half of the 127 thousand, or 56 thousand renovators, are assumed to incur the training costs in the
first year. Since the opt-out provision is not eliminated until the second year under Option C (June 2011),
it is assumed that no training costs are incurred in the first year under Option C. A simplifying
assumption was necessary because it is not possible to predict the precise timing of the training and
certification that would occur under the various options. In reality, any additional firms and renovators
that become certified and trained because of the removal of the opt-out provision may do so before the
removal of the opt-out provision goes into effect. Thus, under Option C, it is unlikely that there would
actually be zero firms certified or renovators trained in the first year after promulgation of the rule.
Benefits
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of
medical observation and scientific research. Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body
and is toxic to many organ systems. As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on
several organ systems. A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them. Young children (from birth through age five)
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently
measured by IQ change).
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and
expected earnings. The estimated value of an IQ point is approximately $13,000, which represents the
present value of a loss in expected lifetime earnings due to a one point IQ drop. This estimated value of
an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as additional
education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels of lead.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-7
Investigating associations between lead exposure and behavior, mood, and social conduct of children has
been an emerging area of research. Early studies indicated linkages between lower-level lead toxicity and
behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, attentional problems, and hyperactivity) in children. Blood-lead
and tooth-lead levels have been associated with behavioral features of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), including distractibility, poor organization, lack of persistence in completing tasks, and
daydreaming, in various cohorts of children with a wide range of lead exposures. The relationship
between lead exposure and delinquent and criminal behavior also has been addressed in several
investigations. Studies linking attention deficits, aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and poor self-
regulation with lead have raised the prospect that early exposure may result in an increased likelihood of
engaging in antisocial behaviors in later life. Elevated lead levels have been associated with several
measures of behavioral disturbance and delinquent behavior.
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased
hypertension.
Both epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead affect
many different organ systems. Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are
among those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or
possibly lower); and these categories of effects are currently of greatest public health concern. Other
newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups are also emerging
as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern. It appears that some of these
effects, particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's
neurobehavioral development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a
threshold.
The proposed rule’s removal of the opt-out provision will apply the LRRP program’s work practices,
training and certification requirements to renovations in all target housing and COFs (including housing
previously eligible for the opt-out provision). This will reduce lead exposure by increasing the
containment and cleanup of dust and debris generated by RRP activities. Additional reductions in lead
exposure will be achieved by prohibiting the use of certain paint preparation and removal techniques in
jobs that require lead-safe work practices. These reductions in exposure will in turn reduce the risks of
adverse health and ecological effects in the vicinity of these activities.
The proposed requirement that renovators provide the owners and occupants of renovated buildings with
copies of the records renovation firms must maintain to document compliance with the rule’s training and
work practice requirements will enable building owners and occupants to better understand what the
renovation firm did to comply with the rule and how the rule’s provisions affected their specific
renovation. Educating the owners and occupants in this way is likely to help them to be better able to
protect themselves from lead-based paint hazards that may have been created by the renovation and
improve their ability to assist the EPA in monitoring compliance with the LRRP rule. These
improvements in education and monitoring will improve compliance with the rule, which will ultimately
protect children and adults from exposure to lead hazards due to renovation activities.
Removing the opt-out provision will protect children and adults from exposure to lead dust from
renovations in a variety of situations. They include children under the age of six who visit a friend,
relative, or caregiver’s house where a renovation has been performed under the opt-out provision;
children who move into such housing when their family purchases it after such a renovation has been
performed; and children who live in a property adjacent to housing where renovation has been performed
under the opt-out provision. Removing the opt-out provision will also protect individuals age 6 and older
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-8
who live in houses that were renovated under the opt-out provision; who move into such housing after
such a renovation has been performed; and who live in adjacent properties.
In addition, removal of the opt-out provision will provide additional protection for women who do not
know they are pregnant at the time a renovation commences, women who become pregnant shortly after a
renovation occurs, and women of child-bearing age in general. This is particularly important because the
transplacental transfer of lead in humans is well documented, and infants are generally born with a lead
body burden reflecting that of the mother.
Removing the opt-out provision will also result in fewer homes being purchased with pre-existing lead
hazards. It is common for home owners to perform activities that disturb paint before selling a house.
Removing the opt-out provision decreases the likelihood of lead hazards being present when new
occupants move into the home.
Eliminating the opt-out provision will also protect individuals residing adjacent to homes undergoing
renovations. Renovations on the exterior of a residence can spread leaded dust and debris some distance
from the renovation activity. There are approximately 1.6 million owner-occupied single-family attached
homes built before 1978 eligible for the opt-out provision. If these homeowners opt out of the LRRP
program, renovations on the exterior of these homes are likely to contaminate neighboring yards and
porches, resulting in exposure inside the neighboring houses as well as outside (because exterior dust is
tracked into the home). Many more single-family detached homes are located in close proximity to each
other, and renovations performed under the opt-out provision present a similar risk for these homes.
Removing the opt-out provision will also provide protection to family pets living in owner-occupied
housing where no children under age 6 or pregnant women reside. Lead poisoning resulting from
renovations has been documented in both cats and dogs, resulting in both veterinary care costs and, in
some instances, loss of a family pet.
EPA has calculated crude benefits numbers for several groups of individuals protected by removing the
opt-out provision. This has been done by estimating the number of individuals in each group and
combining this with the average benefit per individual for a similar group from previous LRRP rule
analyses. These averages do not replicate the scenarios used in the previous analyses, which included an
array of factors such as age of child, type of renovation, size of job, and building vintage, so the
calculations in this chapter do not reflect the methodology that EPA previously had peer reviewed for the
LRRP rule analysis.
As a result of severe time constraints for the conduct of this analysis, the average benefits per individual
from the previous analyses have not been modified to reflect any differences in exposure between
populations protected by the 2008 rule and those protected by the removal of the opt-out provision.
While these values can serve as a proxy to provide a sense of the magnitude of benefits from this action,
the amount of error in these values is unknown.
Estimating benefits from avoided lead exposure is not an issue that lends itself to simplified calculations.
Thus, the benefits calculations used here should be viewed as crude indicators of the magnitude of
benefits. In light of this, the analysis calculates benefits under two different scenarios. In one of the
scenarios, aggregate benefits are based on average benefits per individual from previous analyses
multiplied by an estimate of the number of people affected by the proposed rule. In the second scenario,
benefits are calculated by applying a simple linear adjustment factor to one of the components in the first
scenario, in order to reflect the uncertainties created by relying on the average benefit per individual from
previous analyses as a basis for the calculation.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-10
Small Entity Impacts
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. The vast majority of entities in the
industries affected by the proposed rule are small. The small entity impact analysis considers firms that
would seek certification as a result of the elimination of the opt-out provision (opt-out entities) separately
from the firms that are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule (currently regulated entities). The
proposed revisions to the renovation, repair, and painting program will affect approximately 289,000
small entities; of those small entities, it is predicted that up to 101,000 will incur certification, work
practice, and training costs as a result of the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision.
Two factors are evaluated in analyzing the rule’s impacts on small entities, (1) the number of firms that
would experience the impact, and (2) the size of the impact. Average annual compliance costs as a
percentage of average annual revenues are used to assess the potential average impact of the rule on small
businesses and small governments. This ratio is a good measure of entities’ ability to afford the costs
attributable to a regulatory requirement, because comparing compliance costs to revenues provides a
reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly available measure
of economic activity. Where regulatory costs represent a small fraction of a typical entity’s revenues, the
financial impacts of the regulation on such entities may be considered as not significant. For non-profit
organizations, impacts are measured by comparing rule costs to the organization’s annual expenditures.
When expenditure data were not available, however, revenue information was used as a proxy for
expenditures. It is appropriate to calculate the impact ratios using annualized costs, because these costs
are more representative of the continuing costs entities face to comply with the rule.
There are approximately 101,000 small entities that would be affected by the removal of the opt-out
provision. The average annualized cost to a typical small entity in this group is estimated to range from
about $1,133 to $6,408 per year, depending on the number of renovation, repair, and painting events
undertaken by a small entity in the industry sector involved. As shown in Table ES-8, the cost impact of
the proposed revisions on small opt-out entities ranges from about 0.8 percent to 1.7 percent of revenues,
depending on the industry sector. (If renovation firms are less specialized than the analysis assumed, in
terms of whether they work in facilities where the RRP program is applicable, impacts will be lower than
calculated because some firms that also work in regulated facilities ineligible for the opt-out provision
will already have incurred costs for training and certification.)
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-11
There are approximately 189,000 small entities that are not predicted to be affected by the removal of the
opt-out provision, but that are expected to be affected by the additional recordkeeping requirements.
These are all entities that were previously assumed to be affected by the 2008 LRRP rule. For a typical
small entity in this group, the average annualized cost of the proposed rule is estimated to range from
about $1 to $283 per year, depending on the number of RRP events undertaken by a small entity in the
industry sector involved. As shown in Table ES-9, the cost impact on currently regulated small entities
ranges from about 0.0001 percent to 0.08 percent of revenues, depending on the industry sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-13
Some of the small entities subject to the rule have employees while others are non-employers. The non-
employers typically perform fewer jobs than firms with employees, and thus have lower work practice
compliance costs. However, they also have lower average revenues than entities with employees, so their
impacts (measured as costs divided by revenues) can be higher. Impact estimates for non-employers
should be interpreted with caution, as some non-employers may have issues related to understatement of
income, which would tend to exaggerate the average impact ratio for this class of small entities.
As shown in Table ES-11, there are 75,000 non-employer renovation contractors estimated to be affected
by the removal of the opt-out provision. The average cost to these contractors is estimated to be $1,193
apiece. This represents 1.3% to 4.7% of reported revenues, depending on the industry sector. This
proposed rule’s new recordkeeping requirement is estimated to affect an additional 96,000 non-employer
renovation contractors not affected by removal of the opt-out provision. The costs to these contractors are
estimated to be $42 apiece. This represents 0.05% to 0.17% of revenues, depending on the industry
sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 1-1
1. Introduction
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead,
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied
facilities (COFs). The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692)
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The existing LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has
been found to create lead hazards. Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint,
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed.
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, and
(2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures.
1.1 Purpose of the LRRP Rule Revisions
Removing the opt-out provision will protect individuals (including children under age 6 and pregnant
women), who visit, move into, or live adjacent to a home renovated under the opt-out provision, from
exposure to lead hazards due to renovation activities. Requiring renovators to provide owners and
occupants of renovated buildings with copies of the records documenting the renovation firm’s
compliance with the rule’s training and work practice requirements will enable them to better understand
what the renovation firm did to comply with the rule and improve their ability to assist the EPA in
monitoring compliance with the RRP rule. EPA anticipates that the rule will further develop a market1
for lead safe renovation services that has been established by past lead rules.
The LRRP rule requires certification of entities that perform renovation, repair and/or painting in
buildings covered by the regulations. This includes construction contractors (including sole practitioners)
as well as landlords and other building owners (such as school districts) that may perform RRP activities
using their own staff. It does not, however, cover renovation, repair and painting (RRP) work performed
by homeowners on their own homes. The certified entity must ensure that all persons performing RRP
activities on behalf of the entity in buildings covered by the rule are either renovators who have received
formal training in EPA-approved work practices from an EPA-accredited course or workers who have
received on-the-job training in these approved work practices. In addition, the rule requires the use of
these approved work practices to ensure that proper cleanup has occurred. Supporting these work
practices, training and certification requirements, EPA is undertaking an enhanced outreach program to
1 These markets are expected to consist of suppliers who offer lead safe renovation services (LSRS) and consumers
who are willing to pay the incremental costs associated with using LSRS over non-LSRS.

educate the general public about the dangers of lead exposure and ways to limit exposure resulting from
RRP activities.
1.2 Goal of the Economic Analysis
The purpose of this report is to analyze various options for the LRRP rulemaking revisions. The report
addresses the requirements for economic analysis of Executive Order 12866 – Regulatory Planning and
Review; the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness
Act (SBRFA); Executive Order 12898 – Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations; Executive Order 13045 – Protection of Children from
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks; the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; Executive Order
12875 – Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership; and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options. The effective date for the recordkeeping
checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options. Options A through D all include containment,
cleaning, and cleaning verification requirements, as well as restricting or prohibiting certain paint removal
practices. However, options A through D differ in terms of the effective dates of the elimination of the
opt-out provision. In addition, the economic analysis considers four options with varying work practice
requirements, Options E1 through E4. Table 1-1 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they
are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both have effective dates of June 2010 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, but
Option A does not phase in the opt-out elimination while Option D is limits opt-out elimination to pre-
1960 structures during Phase 1 of the regulation and expands the requirements to structures built between
1960 and 1978 in Phase 2, which has an effective date of June 2011. Options B and C have effective
dates of January 2011 and June 2011 for the elimination of the opt-out provision respectively, and neither
option phases in this requirement.
Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of regulated structures as Option A,
but consider alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same containment requirements
as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning verification work practices. Option E2
has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any
containment work practices. Option E3 has the same cleaning requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does
not include any containment or cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same
containment, cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not restrict or
prohibit any paint removal practices.

1.3 Organization of this Report
Chapter 2 profiles the RRP industry, as well as non-profit and governmental suppliers of childcare
including family daycare providers. It examines the supply of and demand for renovation, remodeling and
painting services. Using data from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Economic Census, the chapter
discusses the size of the RRP industry and characteristics of its firms, as well as the organizational
structure and competitiveness of the industry. The demand for RRP services is characterized and the
factors that affect demand are discussed. Other affected industries (e.g. training providers, property
owners and managers) are also profiled in this chapter.
Chapter 3 characterizes the lead contamination problem to be addressed under the proposed rule. It
discusses how incomplete information and external costs have resulted in inefficient levels of lead
contamination resulting from renovation activity, and introduces regulation as a reasonable solution for
these market failures. The chapter also reviews state and local regulations that affect RRP activities and
demonstrates that these are not sufficient to address the problem.
Chapter 4 describes in detail the methods used to calculate costs of the various regulatory options
considered. It describes the data sources used and is organized around the four general categories of costs
incurred under the proposed rule: work practice compliance costs, training costs, certification and
administrative costs, and checklist provision costs. The last section of the chapter estimates the costs of
each option over a 50-year period and presents annualized costs at both 3 percent and 7 percent.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 1-4
Chapter 5 calculates crude benefits numbers for several groups of individuals protected by removing the
opt-out provision. While these values can serve as a proxy to provide a sense of the magnitude of benefits
from this action, the amount of error in these values is unknown.
Chapter 6 presents findings of distributional analyses relevant to specific rule-making requirements,
including small business impacts, environmental justice, protection of children and unfunded mandates.

2. Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Industry Profile
The LRRP rule for target housing and child occupied facilities (COFs) was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR
21692) and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The existing LRRP regulations apply to entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in target housing or child occupied facilities, including building owners or managers who
use their own staff to conduct RRP activities. These entities must become certified by EPA, ensure that
their employees are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when
disturbing lead-based paint.
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, (2)
an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures, and (3) clarifications and other technical changes to the LRRP
program that do not have cost implications.
Target housing is defined in section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as any housing
constructed before 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child
under age 6 resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling.
A COF is defined under the rule in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §745.83, as:
Child-occupied facility means a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978,
visited regularly by the same child, under 6 years of age, on at least two different days within any
week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and
the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the combined annual visits last at least 60
hours. Child-occupied facilities may include, but are not limited to, day care centers, preschools
and kindergarten classrooms. Child-occupied facilities may be located in target housing or in
public and commercial buildings. With respect to common areas in public and commercial
buildings that contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only
those common areas that are routinely used by children under age 6, such as restrooms and
cafeterias. Common areas that children under age 6 only pass through, such as hallways,
stairways, and garages are not included. In addition, for public and commercial buildings that
contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only the exterior sides
of the building that are immediately adjacent to the child-occupied facility or the common areas
routinely used by children under age 6.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-2
The term renovation is defined in 40 CFR §745.83 to encompass a wide variety of construction activities:
Renovation means the modification of any existing structure, or portion thereof, that results in the
disturbance of painted surfaces, unless that activity is performed as part of an abatement as
defined by this part (40 CFR § 745.223). The term renovation includes (but is not limited to): the
removal, modification or repair of painted surfaces or painted components (e.g., modification of
painted doors, surface restoration, window repair, surface preparation activity (such as sanding,
scraping, or other such activities that may generate paint dust)); the removal of building
components (e.g., walls, ceilings, plumbing, windows); weatherization projects (e.g., cutting
holes in painted surfaces to install blown-in insulation or to gain access to attics, planing
thresholds to install weather-stripping), and interim controls that disturb painted surfaces. A
renovation performed for the purpose of converting a building, or part of a building, into target
housing or a child-occupied facility is a renovation under this subpart.
Thus, renovation includes repair work as well as painting work involving sanding, scraping, or other paint
removal. Renovation activities are conducted without the intent of removing lead, but may disturb it in
the process. Lead abatement activities, on the other hand, are conducted with the intent to remove lead-
based paint or otherwise permanently eliminate a lead-based paint hazard. Depending on the reason they
are undertaken, many activities, such as replacing windows, can be either renovation or abatement.
Because the rule will address renovation, rather than abatement activity, this profile characterizes the
renovation industry as opposed to the abatement services industry.
The industry profile is categorized into eight sections. Section 2.1 discusses the supply of contractor-
provided renovation services. Section 2.2 presents information on the numbers and types of child care
facilities and schools. Section 2.3 presents information on the number and sizes of non-residential
property owners and managers likely to be affected by the rule. Section 2.4 focuses on the demand-side
of renovation by identifying the quantity of renovation activities performed. Section 2.5 discusses the
overall market organization for the renovation industry. Section 2.6 describes the residential property
owner and manager industry. Section 2.7 discusses training providers. Section 2.8 provides an overview
of the structures that would be affected by the revisions to the LRRP rule.
2.1 Contractors that Supply Renovation Services
Data from the U.S. Economic Census were used to identify the North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) industry groups that may provide renovation, repair and painting work (U.S. Census
Bureau 2004a). An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it
derives the greatest share of its revenues. These activities may or may not make up the majority of work
(i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related
(or unrelated) lines of work. The analysis identified 12 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast
majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule. Affected industry groups
include two building construction sectors (NAICS 236118 – Residential Remodelers; and NAICS 236220
– Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) and ten specialty trade contractor sectors.
The number of contracting establishments affected is also discussed in Chapter 4. This profile examines
the financial and employment characteristics of construction establishments likely to provide renovation
work in child-occupied facilities.
NAICS sectors likely to perform projects regulated under the LRRP rule, as well as examples of the work
they perform, are presented in Table 2-1.

2.1.1 Number of Establishments with Employees
The U.S. Economic Census tracks businesses with paid employees (employer establishments) and non-
employer establishments (self-employed contractors) separately.1 This discussion deals with employer
establishments only; non-employers are addressed in the next section.
Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group
of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time
during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year
were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment
employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected
sectors. Overall, Other Building Equipment contractors have the largest number of employees per
establishment (20.8 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

Table 2-3 presents the total number of employees and the number of construction workers in each
identified industry. The number of employees “includes all full-time and part-time individuals on the
payrolls of construction establishments during any part of the pay period which included the 12th of
March, May, August, and November” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). The number of construction
workers “includes all payroll workers (up through the working supervisory level) directly engaged in
construction operations, such as painters, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians… journeymen,
mechanics…truck drivers and helpers.” Non-construction employees include “payroll employees in
executive, purchasing, accounting, …and routine office functions” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).
Because construction workers form the vast majority of the people who require training under the rule,
1 Data at the firm level were not available for these NAICS groups when the analysis was performed.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-5
their role in the composition of each sector’s labor force provides an indication of the extent to which
each sector will be affected by the regulations.
In total, about 3.8 million people work for the 394,365 establishments in the potentially affected
industries. About 73 percent of these employees are construction workers. The affected sectors differ in
terms of the composition of their labor force. For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of
employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector. In the Residential Remodelers sector,
however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c)
2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments
As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from
establishments with employees. Data on the number of non-employer establishments were available from
the U.S. Small Business Administration. A non-employer firm “is defined as one that has no paid
employees, has annual business receipts of $1,000 or more ($1 or more in the construction industries),
and is subject to federal income taxes” (U.S. Small Business Administration 2006a). Essentially, non-
employers are self-employed contractors. Because little financial and operational data is available for
non-employers, the vast majority of this profile focuses on establishments with employees. This
subsection discusses the number of non-employers in the affected industry sectors and the receipts of
these establishments.
The U.S. Small Business Administration did not provide data on the number or revenues of non-employer
establishments in each of the 6-digit level NAICS industries addressed in this profile. Data on the
number of such establishments was available for Plumbing and HVAC contractors (NAICS 238220) and
Electrical contractors (NAICS 238210) only; for the remaining industries, data was provided at the more
general 4-digit NAICS level. In total, there are nearly 1.2 million self-employed contractors.
To estimate the number of non-employer establishments in each of the 6-digit sectors, it was assumed that
the distribution of non-employer establishments in each 4-digit NAICS code is the same as the
distribution of establishments with payroll in the same 4-digit group. Similarly, to estimate the revenues

same as the distribution of revenues of payroll establishments in the same 4-digit industry.

2.1.3 Financial Profile
In this section, Census data is used to examine key financial indicators for the renovation industry. The
indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction
subcontracted out to others) and labor costs. Net value of construction work is used instead of the total
value of construction work because it is a measure of the work actually performed by the establishment.
Table 2-5 presents the average per establishment net value of construction work (NVCW) for each
industry sector. The table also presents labor costs as a percent of the net value of construction for each
of the affected NAICS codes.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-7
Table 2-5 shows the wide range of values of construction work per establishment across all NAICS codes
of interest. The average establishment in the Residential Remodeler industry (NAICS 236118) has the
smallest net value of construction work ($370,000), followed by the Finish Carpentry contractors industry
($446,000). Meanwhile, the average establishment in the Commercial Building Construction industry
(NAICS 236220) has the largest net value of construction value ($2,909,000), with the Other Building
Equipment contractors industry netting the second largest value ($2,247,000). It should come as no
surprise that the Commercial Building Construction industry’s net value of construction is so much larger
than the Residential Remodeler industry’s net value of construction work given that commercial building
construction projects tend to be substantially larger in scope and size than residential remodeling projects.
As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the
industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering
contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of
construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor
cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S.
Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small
percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to
covering the cost of materials and profit.

2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket
The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler
and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year
or less. The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year
(U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than
establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was
only available at the establishment level. Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few
establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm
data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry.
The remainder of this section examines the number of establishments, number of employees, net value of
construction work and value of business done2 distributed by establishment revenue bracket. These data
were available from the 2002 Economic Census at the NAICS code level only. Establishments were
classified into two revenue categories based on the total value of business done – those with revenues less
that $10 million and those with revenues greater than $10 million. Because the Census groups all
establishments with revenues of $10 million or more into one revenue bracket, it is not possible to
determine what percentage of Residential Remodeler nor Commercial Building Construction
establishments have revenues of less than $33.5 million. Note, however, that nearly 100 percent of
Residential Remodeler establishments have revenues of less than $10 million per year. The same cannot
be said for Commercial Building Construction establishments, as 12 percent have revenues greater than
$10 million per year. The percent of establishments, employees and net value of construction contributed
by establishments in each revenue bracket is presented in Table 2-6.
2 Value of business done is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as including “the sum of value of construction work
and other business receipts. Value of business done is the sum of receipts, billings, or sales from establishments of
construction business activities plus receipts from other business activities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2004d).

The distribution of the number of establishments for all twelve NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward
smaller establishments. In five out of twelve industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have
revenues below $10 million. For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-10
million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial
Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3).
Thus, about 98 percent of all establishments in the affected industries have revenues well below the SBA
definition of small business.
Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 41 and 95 percent of total
employment for each sector, and about 69 percent of employment overall. The distribution of the net
value of construction work and the total value of business done is skewed toward smaller establishments
in a manner similar to the distribution of employees. Establishments with revenues of less than $10
million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and
91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector. It is worth mentioning that if the
Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump
to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 58 percent of the net
value of construction work and 50% of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau
2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).
2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done
In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly
on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total
establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments. Figure 2-1 examines labor and
material costs, as well as the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of the total value
of business done for the twelve affected sectors. While the rule will increase the cost of material slightly,
the major impact will be on labor costs, including the training of staff. Each of the sectors was broken
down into two size categories by revenue bracket: less than $10 million and $10 million and more. The
cost of labor, of materials, and of construction work subcontracted out was summed across the 12 industry
sectors for large and for small establishments. These values were then compared to their total value of
business.
Labor costs, material costs, and the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of total
value of business done are presented in Figure 2-1. Regardless of size of establishments, material costs
tend to be a slightly larger percentage of total revenues than do labor costs. Labor costs make up about 25
percent of revenues for small establishments and about 16 percent for large establishments. Based on
Census data, large establishments subcontract out a much larger percentage of their work than do small
businesses.
3 Once again, this difference arises because of the larger size of a majority of Commercial building construction
projects. Regardless, if only 12% earn revenues greater than $10 million, it can easily be assumed that a much
smaller percentage of establishments in this industry earn revenues greater than the SBA cutoff of $33.5
million.

2.2 Child Care and Schools: Child Occupied Facilities
For the purposes of analysis, COFs are divided into the following categories4:
 Kindergartens and Pre-Kindergartens in Schools: Located in public and private schools;
 Daycare centers: Organized (licensed) facilities located in public and commercial buildings;
 Family daycare: Organized (licensed) daycare facilities located in the provider’s home; and
 Informal daycare: Informal (i.e. not licensed) day care providers, including relatives and non-
relatives. Some of these providers may be paid for their services.
There is a great deal of diversity and complexity in the childcare industry. The formal childcare sector
consists primarily of two types of facilities – center-based care and family daycare. Daycare centers are
typically located in commercial or educational buildings, including schools and university campuses.
They include private for-profit and non-profit facilities that can operate as independent centers or as part
of chains. For-profit facilities can be found in office buildings, factories, other workplace settings, or in
stand-alone facilities. Non-profit facilities may be found in YMCAs or other community centers,
churches, college and university campuses, as well as in office or stand-alone buildings. Government
4 The analysis is limited to kindergartens, pre-schools, daycare centers, family daycare, and informal daycare. Due
to a lack of data, it does not include other facilities that may qualify as COFs under the rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-12
education and human services agencies also provide daycare through programs such as Head Start, as
well as through kindergarten and pre-kindergarten programs at local schools.
Unlike center-based care, family daycare is typically offered in the home of the caregiver. Family
daycare facilities tend to serve smaller groups of children and have a smaller child-to-caregiver ratio
(KeepKidsHealthy 2001). In addition to formal care provided by daycare centers, schools, and family
daycare, children may also be cared for informally by relatives, family friends, or other acquaintances.
Informal care may be paid or unpaid, and usually takes place at the home of either the child or the
provider.
Table 2-7 summarizes the types and numbers of facilities and childcare providers in this universe,
grouping them by the age of their construction. It shows that the rule would apply to 1,656,000 child-
occupied facilities, of which 1,559,000 are in target housing.

2.2.1 Daycare Centers and Family Daycare
Establishments involved in the provision of day care of infants or children are classified under NAICS
624410 – Child Day Care Services. This industry covers child day care centers (including those located
in the provider’s home), pre-school centers, nursery schools and pre-kindergarten centers (except as part
of elementary schools). In 2002, Census reported that this industry included over 55,000 firms that
employed nearly 752,000 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005d). Furthermore, Census reports 618,947
non-employers in the industry (U.S. Census Bureau 2005k).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-13
While Census covers both family and center-based childcare under NAICS 624410, there is reason to
believe that Census undercounts the number of employer firms in this industry. This is likely to occur for
two reasons. First, it is likely that the number of firms reported by Census primarily includes centers,
since care provided solely by one person (as occurs at many family daycare establishments) would be
classified under non-employer statistics. Second, Census classifies a business into NAICS 624410 if its
primary line of business is the provision of child day care services; it is likely that many facilities have
alternate primary lines of business (YMCAs and churches, for example). The number of non-employers,
on the other hand, is likely to include care providers such as nannies or babysitters that do not constitute
formal care, but that cannot be disentangled from the total count.
In light of the limitations of the Census data, an alternative data source is used for this analysis. In 2005,
the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in conjunction with the National
Childcare Information Center (NCCIC) conducted a study on the number and licensed capacity of daycare
centers and family daycare establishments in the 50 U.S. states. Based on these data, there are
approximately 115,000 licensed daycare centers in the United States. Because licensing requirements
differ from state to state, this count includes 105,444 facilities licensed as daycare centers, as well as
about 10,000 facilities such as Head Start, religious daycare, and other similar establishments, which are
required to obtain a license in some states, but must only be registered or certified in others.
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) First National Health Survey
of Childcare Centers, about 22 percent of licensed daycare centers are located in elementary schools.
Since throughout this analysis, schools are analyzed separately from daycare centers, the number of
daycare centers was reduced by 22 percent, bringing the total number of centers to 89,260. According to
NCES data on public and private schools, however, an additional 1,421 schools without kindergartens
have a pre-kindergarten program (See Section 2.2.2.1). These 1,421 centers are also excluded from the
total center counts to avoid double-counting, bringing the number of centers to 87,840.
In addition to the 115,000 centers, NARA reported a total of 166,514 licensed small family childcare
homes and 47,452 large family childcare homes.5 With the addition of about 16,000 family daycare
homes that are reported as certified, not licensed, NARA reports a total of 229,875 family daycare
facilities.
Because some states either completely exempt family daycare with fewer than a certain number of
students from licensing requirements, or offer voluntary registration, the family daycare numbers reported
by NARA are likely to underestimate the total family daycare universe. As such, to estimate the number
of family daycares, this analysis relied on a 2002 report by the Center for the Childcare Workforce, which
provides data on family childcare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes. Based on
these data, it is estimated that there are a total of 591,071 family daycare facilities in the United States.
Table 2-8 summarizes the size of the formal (center and family daycare) childcare universe.

used by SBA.

2.2.1.1 Daycare Center and Family Daycare Outlook
Figure 2-2 plots changes in the numbers of licensed child-occupied facilities between 1995 and 2004
using information compiled from the Childcare Licensing Studies published annually by the Children’s
Foundation and the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA).6 These data give larger
counts than the data above because they include facilities in Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.7
But the trends displayed in this data are likely to be present in the smaller data set. The number of
licensed Childcare Centers has grown gradually over time, from 92,000 in 1995 to 120,000 facilities in
2004. The number of Large/Group Family Childcare Homes grew in a similar manner, before tapering
off in 2004. Over the time period specified, the number of Small Family Childcare Homes declined from
276,000 to 256,000, while exhibiting much more variation from year to year than the other two
categories. Here, as noted earlier, large and small refer to the number of children enrolled, not the SBA
definition of a large or small entity.
6 When the Children’s Foundation closed in 2005, NARA assumed sole responsibility for collecting licensing
information through the annual study. However, because the methodology was altered with the new leadership,
data from the 2005 Childcare Licensing Study were not included into Figure 2-2.
7 While the rule would apply to Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands, they are not included in this analysis for
reasons of consistency since some of the major data sources used elsewhere in the analysis were limited to the
50 states and the District of Columbia. Holding all other things equal, by not including COFs in Puerto Rico,
Guam, and the Virgin Islands, the analysis underestimates the costs and benefits of the rule.

The market for lead-safe renovation activities in COFs is dependent on the number of care providing
facilities. Figure 2-2 indicates that while there have been some fluctuations in the underlying components
of the overall market, when considered over the entire time frame, the number of licensed COFs has been
relatively stable.
While there wasn’t significant growth in childcare over the 1995-2004 timeframe, a study forecasts
growth in the demand for childcare labor. Fueling the future demand for childcare services is the
expected increase in the amount of children below 5 between 2004 and 2014. Adding to this growing
demand will be an increased female labor force participation rate, forcing families to find alternate care
options for their children. Furthermore, many states will be implementing their own care programs for 3-
and 4- year old children in the coming years. The government also plans to increase subsidies for low-
income families attending day care programs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). While trends point to
increased demand for childcare labor, it is difficult to assess whether this will be accompanied by an
increase in the number of facilities, and to what extent these new facilities will be located in pre-1978
buildings.
2.2.1.2 Informal Daycare
Informal daycare is provided by unlicensed providers, including relatives, friends, and others.
Calculations determining the number of informal daycare providers are based on figures and percentages
found in a report on the number of paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare entitled
“Estimating the Size Components of the U.S. Childcare Workforce and Caregiving Population: Key
Findings from the Childcare Workforce Estimate” (Center for Childcare Work Force 2002).8

Target Housing COFs
Family daycare and informal daycare take place in target housing. Renovation events in some target
housing COFs would be regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule regardless of their status as a COF; for
example, if they are owner-occupied units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides
or if they are rental units. For a detailed explanation of the methodology used to estimate the number of
target housing COFs, please see Section 4.2 of Chapter 4. Section 2.8 presents the estimated numbers of
target housing COFs affected by the rule.
2.2.2 Public and Private Schools
This section describes the number and size of public and private schools with kindergartens and pre-
kindergartens.
2.2.2.1 Number of Schools
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2004-2005 academic year, there
were 93,295 public schools with students in the United States. In total, these schools served 48.8 million
students (NCES 2006a). The rule will apply only to those portions of schools that meet the COF
definition. Thus, the rule is expected to primarily impact schools that have kindergarten or pre-
kindergarten programs. According to the NCES’s Public Elementary and Secondary School Universe
Survey, which collects data on all operational public schools in the United States, in 2004-2005, 52,129
of the 93,295 U.S. public schools (roughly 56 percent) provided either pre-kindergarten or kindergarten
services.9 Of these 52,129 schools, 20,885 offered both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and 29,884
schools provided kindergarten services only. Only 1,400 schools offered pre-kindergarten, but not
kindergarten services; this group of schools includes standalone preschools operated by local school
boards, as well as daycare centers located in public middle schools, high schools, and ungraded schools
(See Table 2-9). Note that these figures are not limited to schools with pre-1978 buildings.

As shown in Table 2-10, in 2004-2005 a total of 990,421 pre-kindergartners and 3,543,554 kindergartners
were enrolled in pre-kindergartens and kindergartens offered at public schools, respectively. Given the
number of programs described above, this means that there are roughly 44 pre-kindergarten students per
school and 70 kindergarten students per school.
9 A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero
students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were
not provided. Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was
greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten,
but did not report kindergarten enrollment.

Number of Public School Districts
Public schools in the United States are operated by local education agencies (LEAs), organizations
“responsible for providing free public elementary/secondary instruction or education support services.”
The National Center for Education Statistics collects data on LEAs through its Common Core of Data
(CCD) fiscal and non-fiscal surveys. NCES designed the Common Core of Data system to
“accommodate the many and varied organizational structures used in the provision of public elementary
and secondary education.” As such the CCD contains records that represent “administrative and
operating units that are unlike typical public schools and school districts – for example, regional
administrative service centers without students.”
According to the CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey, in 2004-2005, 17,647 LEAs operated
in the 50 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Of these 17,647 agencies, 14,473 operated at
least one school that offered pre-kindergarten or kindergarten services and may thus be affected by the
rule.
Of the 14,473 local education agencies responsible for schools with pre-kindergarten and kindergarten
programs, just under 13,200 are typical public school districts (usually county or town agencies
responsible for providing education services in that location). An additional 949 agencies are charter
school organizations. The remaining 333 agencies represent regional, state, and federal institutions, as
well as supervisory union administrative centers.10 Table 2-11 presents a detailed breakdown of the
number of education agencies by agency type, as well as counts of schools with pre-kindergartens and/or
kindergartens operated by each agency.
10 Supervisory union administrative centers operate schools only in Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia.

School District Finance Survey. Table 2-12 presents the total revenues, average revenues, and percent
revenues derived from federal, state, and local funds for education agencies operating schools with pre-
kindergarten and/or or kindergarten programs. All figures are based only on agencies with available data;

Table 2-13 presents the total and average expenditures of local education agencies. Total expenditures
are composed of total current expenditures for elementary/secondary education, as well as other
expenditures. Elementary/secondary education current expenditures include expenditures for instruction
(e.g. teacher salaries), support services (including, but not limited to, administrative, maintenance, and
operations costs), and other expenses, such as transportation and food services. Other expenditures
include spending not related to elementary/secondary education, such as expenditures for community
service, or adult education, capital outlay expenditures, payments to other government and educational
entities, and debt interest payments. In Table 2-13 current expenditures are split out by type, while the
remainder (capital and non-educational) are combined and labeled as “all other” expenditures.

For most LEAs, the majority of expenditures (51 percent on average, across all LEAs) are spent on
instruction. In aggregate, the category containing maintenance costs (i.e. support service) makes up
around one-third of all expenditures. Lastly, the “all other” expenditures category makes up a significant
percentage of the expenditures for regional education services agencies.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, public school districts are considered large if they serve a
population of more than 50,000. Table 2-14 presents the number of LEAs that operate schools that have
pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens, by agency type and the size of the population served.

Private schools
In 2003-2004, the National Center for Education Statistics conducted a survey of private schools in the
United States. NCES’s Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States: Results From the 2003-
2004 Private School Universe Survey (2006) presents a summary of survey results, including numbers of
schools currently in operation, the number of students enrolled, and teachers employed. Table 2-15
presents summary statistics on national private schools, including a total count of all private schools,
enrollment and teachers, as presented in NCES’s report.

According to the NCES data, in 2003-2004 there were 34,681 private schools in the U.S., enrolling a total
of just over 5.2 million students, with a total teaching staff of over 441,000. On average, there were 150
students enrolled in a private school and 13 teachers per school. These figures must be interpreted with
caution however, since they encompass elementary schools, secondary schools, etc. which, by definition,
include different numbers of classes.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-22
While the NCES report provides some data on the number of private schools by grade level, it does not
provide data on grades offered by each individual school in the survey. In order to identify schools with
kindergartens only, pre-kindergartens and kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only, this analysis relied
on the Excel database underlying NCES’s 2003-2004 report. This database, which contains records for
29,907 of the estimated 34,461 private schools in the United States, specifies the highest and lowest grade
offered at each school, as well as the number of students enrolled in each grade. The database, however,
does not include sampling weights used to adjust some of the survey results to generate final numbers
presented in NCES’s report. In order to most accurately estimate the number of schools offering each
combination of kindergarten or pre-kindergarten programs, as well as the number of children enrolled in
these programs, this analysis:
 used the underlying database to identify schools with pre-kindergartens only, kindergartens only,
and both kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, then
 inflated these counts to account for the 4,500 schools that were not included in the database. The
numbers of schools offering each combination of programs was inflated using the ratio of the
number of schools presented in the published report to the number of schools included in the
database. Similarly, the number of children in each school setting, estimated based on the
underlying data, was adjusted using the ratio of the number of kindergartners presented in the
published report to the number of kindergartners reported in the database.11
Table 2-16 breaks down the totals from the previous table to provide a count of the number of private
schools with pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens.

kindergarten and kindergarten services. Only 21 private schools provided pre-kindergarten but not
11 In its report, NCES tracks schools where kindergarten is the highest grade offered separately from regular
elementary, middle and high schools. As such, when inflating counts obtained from underlying data, the
analysis calculated two sets of ratios for the numbers of schools and numbers of children enrolled – one for
regular, and another for kindergarten-terminal schools.

services. Note that these figures are not limited to schools in pre-1978 buildings.
Table 2-17 presents a count of the number of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students served in private
schools, as well as the average number of students served per school.

According to Table 2-17, there are 26,510 private schools with kindergartens, enrolling a total of 555,531
kindergarteners. Also, there are 19,326 private schools with pre-kindergartens, enrolling 863,542 pre-
kindergarten students. The average number of private pre-kindergarten students per school (45) is more
than double the average number of kindergarten students (21). Whereas public schools displayed nearly
the opposite ratio with on average 44 pre-kindergarten students and 70 kindergarten students per school.
Non-profit organizations, including private schools, are defined as small under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act if they are independently owned and operated and not dominant in their field. While determining
whether a school meets this definition is difficult, it is useful to present some statistics describing the size
distribution of private schools. Table 2-18 shows the distribution of private schools by the number of
students they serve. This represents the total number of students served, and not just the number of
kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students.

Source: NCES 2006e
The distribution of private schools in the U.S. is heavily skewed toward smaller schools, with 94% of
private schools serving less than 500 students and 99% of private schools serving less than 1000 students.
13 Beginning in 1995, the definition of school employed by the Private School Survey was expanded to include
schools whose highest grade was kindergarten. Therefore, these statistics are likely to include some pre-
kindergartens that are more likely also classified as preschools in other sources (NCES 2006e). Later sections
explain how the calculations avoid double-counting. However, because this is a small figure, it is almost
negligible.

However, these data do not indicate whether the schools are affiliated with or part of a larger
organization.
2.3 Nonresidential Commercial Property Owners and Managers
Nonresidential commercial property owners and managers will be affected by the rule if they rent space to
daycare facilities or other COFs in buildings constructed prior to 1978. The number and size of firms in
this industry is described below.
2.3.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics
Firms involved in the leasing of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses) are classified under
NAICS 531120 – Lessors of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses). In 2002, this industry
included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).
Firms involved in the management of non-residential properties are classified under NAICS 531312 –
Nonresidential property managers. In 2002, this industry included 10,506 firms that employed 125,616
people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).14 Table 2-19 includes only firms with employees. The U.S. Census
Bureau does not differentiate between self-employed individuals that lease or manage commercial real
estate as opposed to residential buildings. This analysis assumes that non-employers primarily lease
residential buildings, rather than commercial property. As such, non-employer establishments are not
included in this profile, or in the remainder of the analysis.

Sources: U.S. Census Bureau 2005j
The 2008 LRRP rule economic analysis (EPA 2008) indicated that a total of 17,705 daycare centers rent
space in pre-1978 buildings. Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments
renting non-residential space, and because the rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to
1978, the analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one regulated
building. As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of daycare
centers renting space, or 17,705.
2.3.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in
NAICS 531120 must have revenues of less than $7 million, while firms in NAICS 531312 must have
revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). Average revenues in these
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-20).
14 Firms involved in the leasing and/or management of residential buildings are already covered under the residential lead RRP

Census data are not specific enough to report revenues at either the $7 million dollar or $2 million dollar
cutoff; Table 2-21 presents the percent of firms in NAICS 531120 and NAICS 531312 that have revenues
below $5 million and $1 million respectively. Consequently, the figures in Table 2-21 are all
underestimates of the true percentages of firms that qualify as small businesses.

Based on 2002 data, 96 percent of NAICS 531120 firms and 81 percent of NAICS 531312 firms have
revenues below $5 million and $1 million, respectively. In the Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings
industry, these firms contribute 32 percent of the industry revenues while employing 73 percent of the
workforce. The revenue and employment distribution is more skewed in the Nonresidential Property
Managers sector. Small firms in this industry contribute only 19 percent of the revenues, while
employing only 26 percent of the workforce.
2.4 The Demand for Renovation Services
The demand for renovation is responsive to changes in the overall economic conditions. The same factors
that stimulate economic growth, such as low unemployment, high consumer confidence and low interest
rates, also stimulate the demand for renovation activities. For both residential and nonresidential building
projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure
composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs
(while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and
engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations,
additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or
service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-26
Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in
place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and
preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational
buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).15 Both real GDP and the value of state and local
construction of elementary school buildings substantially increased over the previous 12 years.
Meanwhile, the value of private preschool construction and private primary and secondary educational
buildings construction have seen more moderate growth, peaking around 2001 and then gradually
tapering off.

Construction is a term that encompasses not only the creation of new buildings but renovations to older
structures as well. While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building
construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction. The U.S. Census
Bureau, however, did compile statistics for the expenditures of non-residential improvements in 1986,
1989, and 1992. The U.S. Census defines improvements as “additions, alterations (renovations,
15 State and Local Construction of Elementary School Buildings is meant to give an indication of public kindergarten
construction, while Private Primary and Secondary Educational Building Construction is meant to give an
indication of private school kindergartens. Since the variables shown in Figure 2-3 are more broadly defined
than the variables of interest, they overestimate the value of construction put in place.

remodeling, etc.) and major replacements.” While not being able to collect data on the number or extent
of the individual projects, the Census was able to make some estimations in the non-residential domain,
concluding that “about 23 percent of all buildings had some improvement work, while about 71 percent
had some expenditures for repair” (U.S. Census Bureau 1999). The collected data, however, were not
specific enough to capture improvement expenditures on COFs. Thus, Table 2-22 presents improvement
expenditures as the percentage of the total value of non-residential educational building construction put
in place in each of the three years for which improvement expenditure data were available.
Table 2-22: Improvement Expenditures as a Percentage of the Value of
Construction Put in Place for Non-Residential Educational Buildings
Type of Construction 1986 1989 1992
Private Non-Residential Educational
Buildings 40% 46% 19%
State and Local Non-Residential
Educational Buildings 58% 35% 41%
Source: U.S. Census Bureau 1999, U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c
As shown in Table 2-22, expenditures on improvements as a percent of the total value of educational
building construction put in place vary year to year. Expenditures on improvement made up between 35
and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local non-
residential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable. These figures indicate
that a substantial amount of non-residential educational building expenditures are for activities that might
disturb lead-based paint. The high frequency of these improvement activities points to the importance of
schools in this rule.
2.5 Renovation Industry Market Structure
The previous sections focused on the supply and demand for renovation services. This section discusses
the overall market structure of the renovation industry.
Firms and consumers interact in markets for goods and services with the results of these interactions
depending on the competitive characteristics of the market. Competitive markets are characterized as
markets with a large number of buyers (e.g., consumers) and sellers (e.g., firms) and relatively
homogeneous goods. In competitive markets, neither firms nor consumers can influence the price of the
good by altering their supply or demand decisions. Oligopolistic, monopolistic and monopsonistic
markets are markets where either firms or consumers have market power and exhibit strategic behavior to
change the price of the good sold. The competitive nature of an industry can be estimated by examining
the following market characteristics.
 Number of establishments;
 Specialization of establishments;
 Number of consumers;
 Barriers to entry;
 Availability of substitutes; and
 Homogeneity of the good/service.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-28
The data in Section 2.1 indicate that there are a large number of firms in the construction industry. Using
data for the twelve NAICS codes, there are approximately 394,365 establishments with employees in
construction sectors potentially affected by the rule. Of these establishments, only 2.3 percent have
annual revenues of $10 million or more. In addition, there are about 1.2 million self-employed contractors
in these industries, all of which are, in all likelihood, considered small by SBA standards. Given the large
number of small establishments, it is unlikely that any one firm exhibits substantial market share in the
overall market for renovation services. It is possible in some geographic areas for a small number of
firms or a single firm to establish a market niche, but overall the market for renovation services appears to
be quite competitive on the supply side.
The relatively low barriers to entry in the renovation industry enhance the competition taking place within
it. Much of the work covered by this rule does not require particularly unusual or high levels of skills.
Renovation work has traditionally attracted recent immigrants because a lack of English is not important
(Farzad 2005). While any training required as part of this rule will increase the skill level, the cost of the
training is expected to be relatively low.
There are also a large number of consumers in the industry. As such, no single consumer of renovation
services is expected to exhibit influence over the price of these services.
There are three sources of substitutes for renovation services. First, consumers can substitute from one
contractor to another. Second, consumers can substitute away from professional renovation and into DIY
work. This is less likely to occur for COFs than for residential RRP work. Operators of COFs must be
certified and have their employees trained in order to do covered RRP in the facility. Third, consumers
can reduce the scope of the project or forgo renovation altogether. However, that is unlikely as the cost of
the rule is a relatively small share of the cost of a renovation. Again, this is less likely to occur for COFs
than for residential RRP work. Many states require annual inspections in COFs that assess the amount of
chipped or peeling lead-based paint and dictate that appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the
risk that it imposes.
Additional characteristics of the RRP market result in reduced demand elasticity. First, some
differentiation in RRP services does exist. Contractors can provide services at a higher price if they can
convince consumers that their services are better or distinctly different from their competitors. This is an
important factor in anticipating the impact of the RRP requirements on contractors. The costs of safely
renovating or repairing target housing and COFs are expected to be higher than traditional methods. If
the consumer is indifferent between safe- or unsafe-lead work practices, then those companies that choose
not to use lead-safe work practices may have a competitive advantage in the market due to lower costs.
However, if the consumer recognizes that higher quality renovation jobs are those jobs completed with
lead-safe work practices, then firms may be able to comply with the regulation and charge a higher price.
Under such a scenario, the consumer’s marginal benefit for an additional unit of safe renovation may be
higher than for an additional unit of unsafe renovation. The consumer who has a preference for lead-safe
work practices would choose to do lead-safe renovation as long as the incremental cost of the lead-safe
renovation is less than the incremental benefit of such a renovation. Also, the market for RRP services is
fragmented and there are substantial costs involved in getting prices. Getting bids from various
contractors takes time and consumers need to compare prices across services that differ along many
dimensions. These difficulties make it easier for firms to increase their prices to cover the costs for the
new requirements.
The combination of a large number of firms, a large number of consumers, low barriers to entry, and
available substitutes indicate that the renovation industry is likely to have a relatively high price elasticity
of supply. The price elasticity of demand, however, may be small in absolute value.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-29
2.6 Residential Property Owners & Managers
Property owners and managers also will be affected by the rule if they choose to perform their own RRP
projects rather than hire an outside contractor or if their renovation and maintenance costs rise as a result
of the regulations.
Property owners and managers may have in-house crews that perform RRP activities. If this is the case,
then the property owners and managers will directly bear the costs of training and certifying their workers
as well as the cost of safe work practices. Furthermore, because all firms that perform regulated RRP
projects will experience an increase in costs due to training of supervisors and workers and the use of safe
work practices, it is assumed that costs to property owners and managers who hire outside contractors will
increase.
2.6.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics
Establishments involved in the leasing of apartments and other residential units are classified under
NAICS 531110 - Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings. This industry, in turn, is divided into
two sub-sectors, NAICS 5311101—Lessors of Apartment Buildings and NAICS 5311109—Lessors of
Dwellings Other than Apartment Buildings. According to the 2002 U.S. Economic Census data, together
these industries include a total of 61,787 establishments that employ 292,405 people (U.S. Census Bureau
2004b).
Establishments involved in the management of residential properties are classified under NAICS
531311—Residential Property Managers. In 2002, this industry included 26,233 establishments that
employed 289,870 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2004b). Table 2-23 presents summary statistics for the
businesses in NAICS 531311 as well as NAICS 531110 and its sub-sectors.

2.6.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in
NAICS 531110 must have annual revenues of less than $7 million, while establishments in NAICS
531311 must have revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration, 2004).
Although data on the number of firms by revenue bracket were not available from the 2002 U.S.
Economic Census when this analysis was performed, the average revenues of establishments in these
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-24).

In 1997, 98.7 percent of the then 51,572 establishments in the Lessors of Residential Buildings and
Dwellings sector had annual revenues below $5 million and about 85 percent of the 19,000 establishments
in NAICS 531311 had revenues less than $1 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a).16 Because 2002 data
on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not available at the time the estimates were
developed, 1997 data was used to estimate the percent of establishments in each industry that qualify for
small business status. Table 2-25 presents the percent of NAICS 531311 and NAICS 531110
establishments that have revenues below $1 million and $5 million, respectively. The table also presents
the percent of industry revenues and employment that can be attributed to these establishments.

Based on 1997 data over 85 percent of NAICS 531311 establishments, and about 99 percent of NAICS
53110 establishments have revenues below the small business threshold defined by SBA. In the
Residential Property Manager industry, these establishments contribute only 35 percent of the revenues,
and employ only 40 percent of the workforce. The revenue and employment distribution is less skewed in
the Lessor of Residential Buildings and Dwellings sector. Small establishments in this industry
contribute about 82 percent of the revenues and employ 86 percent of the workforce (U.S. Census Bureau
2000a).
2.6.3 Industry Outlook
The market for lead-safe renovation activities will depend in part on the state of the rental housing
market—an increase in rents would provide resources to construct new housing and/or renovate existing
16 Includes establishments open year-round only.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-31
housing. According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), “rents fell in 9 of
the 27 metropolitan areas tracked by the federal government [in 2003]. Nationally, real contract and gross
rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased
home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004).
At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to
9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of
2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market
over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.”
The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home
ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004).
2.7 Training Providers
Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry. Certified renovators will need
accredited training. Both initial and refresher training courses will be required for certified renovators.
2.7.1 Definitions and Industry Characteristics
It is likely that lead-based paint training courses will be provided by establishments categorized as
NAICS code 611519: Other Technical and Trade Schools. Census defines NAICS 61159 as
“establishments primarily engaged in offering job or career vocational or technical courses (except
cosmetology and barber training, aviation and flight training, and apprenticeship training). The
curriculums offered by these schools are highly structured and specialized and lead to job-specific
certification” and these establishments are believed to currently provide training for lead abatement
professionals (U.S. Census Bureau 2004p).
According to the 2002 Economic Census, there are a total of 3,323 establishments in the U.S. certified as
Other Technical and Trade Schools (see Table 2-26). On average, each establishment employs 15.3
people. A striking characteristic is that about 19% of these establishments are exempt from the Federal
Income Tax (FIT). Exempt establishments include non-profit organizations and educational institutions
such as colleges or universities.

Table 2-27 summarizes available financial information for establishments categorized under NAICS
611519. These include total revenues for the sector, average annual revenues per establishment, annual
payroll for the sector, and payroll as a percent of revenue. As Table 2-27 indicates, for Other Technical
and Trade schools, annual payroll is equal to about 35 percent of establishment revenue.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in order to qualify as a small business, a firm
categorized under NAICS 611519 must have annual revenues of $7 million or less (U.S. Small Business
Administration 2006a).17 The 2002 Economic Census provided data on the number of firms by revenue
bracket. In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that
were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This
figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus
qualified for small business status.
2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments
As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade
school industry. It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based
paint-related training. To help characterize the lead training segment of the training provider industry, a
random sample of firms that offer one or more of the courses required for EPA lead abatement
certification were identified as part of the economic analysis of the 2006 proposed LRRP target housing
rule (EPA 2006). The goal was both to collect tuition data for currently offered lead abatement training
courses and to learn what types of institutions (private establishments, non-profits, unions, etc.) offer
these classes.
The sample consisted of 83 establishments selected from the Lead Listing18 directory of 194 training
providers.19 Data were collected from company web sites (when available) and/or over the phone.
Information was obtained from 68 training providers; a total of 15 training providers could not be
reached. Seven of the 68 contacted providers no longer offered lead abatement training courses.
There were five types of training providers in the sample: private for-profit establishments, non-profit
establishments, educational institutions, trade unions and public/government training institutions. Trade
unions provide tuition-free training to their members. Public/government providers train state employees
and workers who qualify for financial assistance through government programs. They do not offer
training to the general public.
17 Effective July 31st, 2006.
18 The Lead Listing (www.leadlisting.org) website was run for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control that contained a directory of lead service
providers. It is no longer in operation (as of late 2004).
19 The sample included all the establishments on the list that are certified to offer a Project Designer course (42
total), as well as a random sample of 41 establishments that were not certified to offer this class. The data were
weighted by the inversed probability of selection into the sample (P=1 for providers that offer a Project
Designer course and P=.270 for providers that do not offer this class). It was assumed that there was no non-
response bias.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-33
Table 2-28 summarizes the number of private establishments, educational institutions, non-profits, unions
and public government providers that appeared in the sample. The table also presents the estimated
national number of providers that fall into each of these categories. More than a third of lead hazard
reduction training providers are private, for-profit establishments. The next largest group of providers is
labor unions, followed by educational institutions (colleges and universities). None of the unions,
however, are certified to offer the Project Designer course. About 13 percent of certified providers either
do not offer training at this time, or have permanently stopped offering lead courses.
More than half of the privately owned, for-profit establishments in the sample (19 out of 35) offer
environmental consulting services in addition to training. Thirteen of the 35 privately-owned providers
specialize in training and do not offer other services. All of these 13 firms offer both lead and asbestos
training courses, as well as, in most cases, OSHA safety, HAZ-MAT and/or mold classes. Although there
was not enough information to determine the services provided by the remaining three companies, these
findings indicate that lead-based paint training providers generally participate in several lines of business.

2.8 Summary Characteristics: Numbers of Structures in the Regulated
Universe
This section provides summary information about the numbers of target housing and public or
commercial building COFs that form the basis for the analyses presented in the subsequent chapters of
this report. Each tally is then subdivided into categories based on the age of the building and the type of
structure. After each table, there is a discussion of how the numbers presented in that table were
calculated.
Table 2-29 provides counts of the number of buildings by type and vintage of building. There are 78.0
million structures covered by the recordkeeping checklist provision of the proposed revisions to the rule,
including 77.9 million target housing units and 0.1 million COFs in public or commercial buildings.
About 40.2 million target housing units would be added to the regulated universe due to the elimination
of the opt-out provision. Table 2-29 also shows the regulated universe under the existing 2008 LRRP rule
(37.7 million target housing units and 0.1 million public and commercial buildings).

2.8.1 Target Housing
This section provides a brief discussion of the estimates of the number of the target housing units
presented in Table 2-29; a detailed explanation of the data sources used to develop these estimates can be
found in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4.
Estimates of the number of housing units by tenure of occupant (owner or renter), age of occupants, and
pregnancy status of occupants were estimated using the 2003 American Housing Survey, which is
described in more detail in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4. Section 4.2 of Chapter 4 also provides a detailed
explanation of the estimated number of target housing units that are defined as COFs. The COFs in target
housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and neighbors who regularly
care for someone else’s children. These estimates include care provided for pay and not for pay, and rely
primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare workforce as published by the Center for Childcare
Workforce, 2002. This report includes data on the number of: (1) family childcare providers caring for
unrelated children, (2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare, and (3) unpaid relatives and
non-relatives providing childcare. Based on data provided by the Center for Childcare Workforce, a total
of just under 2.4 million caregivers provide care outside of the child’s home for more than six hours per
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-35
week. As described in detail in Section 4.2, these data are used to estimate the number of COFs in target
housing. These numbers are further reduced to estimate the number of pre-1960 and pre-1978 housing
units based on American Housing Survey data.
2.8.2 Childcare Centers
In 2006, the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) released a report entitled “The
2005 Childcare Licensing Study” providing counts of all the licensed childcare centers and family
childcare homes in the United States. The NARA report indicated that there were approximately 115,000
licensed childcare centers, 66,700 of which are estimated to be built before 1978 according to
Commercial Building Energy Consumption Suevey (CBECS) data (DOE 2003). According to HUD's
First National Health Survey of Childcare Centers (HUD 2003), approximately 24 percent of licensed
centers are located in elementary schools. These 15,753 centers are assumed to be included in the
estimated 40,190 elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens. Thus, there are a total of
50,947 pre-1978 daycare centers located outside of elementary schools. According to NCES data on
public and private schools, however, an additional 824 pre-1978 schools without kindergartens have a
pre-kindergarten program, which brings the total number of buildings accounted for as daycare centers to
51,771 (EPA 2008).
2.8.2.1 Public Schools
The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that during the 2004-2005 academic year,
there were more than 93,000 public schools in the United States. Of these 93,295 public schools, 52,129
had either a pre-kindergarten (PK) or kindergarten (K) program. The Common Core of Data Public
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey data was used to calculate the number of private schools
with PK or K programs. Using this data, a school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-
kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade
offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were not provided. Similarly, a school was considered
as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that
the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment.
Again, the educational building age distribution found in CBECS and HUD (2003) was applied to the
total counts, resulting in the estimated 17,000 pre-1960, and 30,000 pre-1978 public schools.
2.8.2.2 Private Schools
This analysis used NCES’s Results from the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey report and the
underlying dataset to estimate the number of private schools with kindergartens and/or pre-kindergartens.
A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than
zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment
data were not provided. Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten
enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-
kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment. The previously cited CBECS
and HUD educational building age distribution was then applied to the private school universe to
calculate the number of private schools by age of construction. This adjustment yielded 9,000 pre-1960,
and 15,000 pre-1978 private schools.
For the purpose of the total cost analysis, private and public schools were categorized according to
whether they offered kindergarten only, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, and pre-kindergarten only.
Table 2-29 uses information drawn from Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 to obtain the total number of schools
with each combination of programs. Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 indicate that there are 29,844 public
schools and 7,205 private schools with kindergarten programs only, for a total of 37,049 such schools.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-36
Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 also indicate that there are 20,885 public schools and 19,305 private schools
with both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs. Finally, there are a total of 1,400 public and 21
private schools with pre-kindergarten, but no kindergarten, which are accounted for as daycare centers for
the purposes of the analysis. Table 2-29 presents the total number of schools with kindergartens,
kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only by age of construction. Information
about the age distribution of buildings was taken from CBECS and HUD and applied to the data to give
estimates of the number of schools by the age of the building.

3. Problem Definition
This chapter begins by characterizing the lead contamination problem, including the various sources of
exposure, presented in Section 3.1. This is followed by a summary of the regulatory background in
Section 3.2. Section 3.3 discusses how market failure due to incomplete information and external costs
result in inefficient levels of lead containment and control in renovation activities, requiring regulatory
intervention. Section 3.4 describes how the proposed rule will address these market failures.
3.1 Lead Contamination Problem
Despite recent reductions in air, water, and food contamination, important sources of lead exposure
remain, due largely to the widespread presence of lead-based paint. Exposure to lead results in increased
blood lead levels associated with various adverse health effects, including reductions in IQ and other
negative cognitive effects, particularly in children. In addition, exposure to lead can result in a variety of
adverse health effects in adults.
3.1.1 Exposure Sources
As described in Chapter 5 lead may cause adverse health effects in any individual, exposed at any stage of
life (in utero through adulthood) (U.S. EPA 2005c). However, young children are particularly susceptible
to lead hazards because their central nervous systems are rapidly developing, and because their behavior
is likely to result in greater exposure to lead than older individuals experience.
Currently, the most significant high-dose source of lead exposure in children under school age is lead-
based paint. Through the 1940's, paint manufacturers used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based
interior and exterior house paints. During the 1950's and 1960's, the usage gradually decreased as new
paints were developed, and in 1978 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) ruled that paint
used for residences, toys, furniture, and public areas must not contain more than 0.06% lead by weight.
Nevertheless, about 50 percent of housing units and public and commercial buildings constructed before
1980 still contain lead-based paint (U.S. HUD 2000). Children’s exposure to lead from lead-based paint
is likely to be high when the paint is in a deteriorated state or is found on accessible, chewable, impact, or
friction surfaces, making the lead paint available to children who ingest paint chips. This “pica” behavior
appears to be rare, but is the likely cause of many of the highest blood lead levels observed in children.
Renovation activities can create lead-based paint hazards for children by making paint chips more
accessible for ingestion. These hazards can occur both within and outside the building unit being
renovated.
In addition to being a source of direct exposure, lead-based paint can be the source of lead contamination
in soil and dust. Children are exposed to lead from soil or dust in their homes as a result of typical hand-
to-mouth activities. Lead-contaminated dust and soil are the major pathway through which most young
children are exposed to lead from lead-based paint hazards. Renovation activities increase the level of
lead dust in the facility and in the soil, thereby increasing the risk of lead ingestion in young children.
While occupational exposure is the primary exposure pathway to lead for adults, other common exposure
pathways for teenagers and adults include gardening, housework, drinking water and certain hobbies such
as creating objects from stained-glass and making pottery. Individuals (children, teenagers and adults) are
also exposed to a variety of other lead sources, some of which are localized in nature.
Airborne lead is present in emissions from lead smelters, battery manufacturing plants, and solid waste
incinerators. The phase-out of leaded gasoline has substantially reduced airborne lead. Drinking water
may become contaminated with lead after it leaves the treatment plant. Although lead levels in drinking
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-2
water generally do not have a statistically significant effect on blood-lead concentrations as a result of
regulations stemming from the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act, water is still considered an important
localized exposure source where lead solder and/or brass plumbing fixtures are present because of the
high absorption rate of lead in water. Lead exposure through food ingestion has declined greatly due to
the phase-out of lead-soldered food cans and public education. With these improvements in exposure
from air, water, and food, lead-based paint remains as the largest widespread source of lead exposure.
3.1.2 Lead from Renovation Activities
EPA exposure data (EPA 1997) indicate that renovation activities potentially increase both short-term and
long-term lead exposure levels. Lead concentrations are greatest in the area where the renovation work is
performed, but lead does settle into other areas of the building and potentially the surrounding area,
causing longer-term exposure. The study found that, with the exception of carpet removal and drilling
into plaster, all renovation activities examined deposited significant amounts of lead onto the floors in the
area where the work was being performed, ranging from 480 micrograms per square foot for sawing to
15,500 micrograms per square foot for paint removal. This lead may be ingested or inhaled by occupants
if proper containment and clean-up practices are not used. The study found that sweeping and shop-
vacuum clean-up, considered to be standard practice in the industry, reduced the total amount of lead
available to occupants. However, as the distance from the activity increased, the cleanup left a higher
percentage of the lead behind so that lead hazards remained following cleanup. These findings
demonstrate that these practices do not adequately reduce risks from lead dust generated by renovation
activities. Lead dust settled in carpeted areas or in soil is the most difficult to remove with simple broom
and vacuum clean-up and thereby creates the longest lasting exposure pathway for facility occupants.
EPA conducted a field study in 2007 (Characterization of Dust Lead Levels after Renovation, Repair, and
Painting Activities) (the ‘‘Dust Study’’) to characterize dust lead levels resulting from various renovation,
repair, and painting activities (EPA 2007). This study was designed to compare environmental lead levels
at appropriate stages after various types of renovation, repair, and painting preparation activities were
performed on the interiors and exteriors of target housing units and child-occupied facilities. All of the
jobs disturbed more than 2 square feet of lead-based paint, so they would not have been eligible for the
minor maintenance exception. The renovation activities were conducted by local professional renovation
firms, using personnel who received lead safe work practices training using the curriculum developed by
EPA and HUD, ‘‘Lead Safety for Remodeling, Repair, and Painting’’ (EPA 2003a). The activities
conducted represented a range of activities that would be permitted under the 2006 Proposal, including
work practices that are restricted or prohibited for abatements under 40 CFR 745.227(e)(6). Of particular
interest was the impact of using specific work practices that renovation firms would be required to use
under the proposed rule, such as the use of plastic to contain the work area and a multi-step cleaning
protocol, as opposed to more typical work practices.
In the Dust Study, 12 different interior and 12 different exterior renovation activities were performed at 7
vacant target housing units in Columbus, Ohio, and 8 vacant target housing units (including four
apartments) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three different interior and three different exterior renovation
activities were conducted at a building representing a child-occupied facility, a vacant school in
Columbus. The presence of lead-based paint was confirmed by laboratory analysis before a building was
assigned a particular renovation activity or set of activities. Before interior renovation activities were
performed, the floors and windowsills in the work area and adjacent rooms were cleaned. In most cases,
pre-work cleaning resulted in dust lead levels on floors of less than 10 μg/ft2; nearly all floors were less
than 40 μg/ft2 before work started. Most windowsills that would be used for later sampling were cleaned
to dust lead levels less than 250 μg/ft2. In the few cases where that level was not achieved on a
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-3
windowsill needed for sampling, dust collection trays were used. Interior renovation activities included
the following jobs:
 Making cut-outs in the walls.
 Replacing a window from the inside.
 Removing paint with a high temperature (greater than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint with a low temperature (less than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint by dry scraping.
 Removing kitchen cabinets.
 Removing paint with a power planer.
To illustrate the impact of the containment plastic and the specialized cleaning and cleaning verification
protocol that would be required by the 2006 Proposal, each activity was performed a minimum of four
times:
 With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by the cleaning protocol
described in the proposal.
 With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by dry sweeping and
vacuuming with a shop vacuum.
 With no plastic containment followed by the cleaning protocol described in the 2006 Proposal.
 With no plastic containment followed by dry sweeping and vacuuming with a shop vacuum.
Dust samples were collected after the renovation work was completed, after cleaning, and after cleaning
verification. If a building was being used again for the same job under different work practices, or for a
completely different job, the unit was recleaned and retested prior to starting the next job. All buildings
were cleaned and tested after the last job.
Geometric mean post-work, pre-cleaning floor dust lead levels in the work room were as follows (in μg/
ft2):
 Cut-outs – 422.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 958.
 Low temperature heat gun- – 2,080.
 Dry scraping – 2,686.
 Window replacement – 3,993.
 High temperature heat gun – 7,737.
 Power planing – 32,644.
Where baseline practices, i.e., no containment, dry sweeping, and vacuuming with a shop vacuum, were
used, the geometric mean post-job floor dust lead levels in the work room were as follows (in μg/ft2):
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-4
 Cut-outs – 22.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 58.
 Low temperature heat gun – 41.
 Dry scraping – 66.
 Window replacement – 135.
 High temperature heat gun – 445.
 Power planing – 450.
The package of proposed rule requirements, i.e., containment, specialized cleaning, and cleaning
verification, resulted in the lowest geometric mean dust lead levels in the work room at the end of a job.
These results were as follows (in μg/ft2):
 Cut-outs – 5.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 12.
 Low temperature heat gun – 24.
 Dry scraping – 30.
 Window replacement – 33.
 High temperature heat gun – 36.
 Power planing – 148.
Windowsill sample results were similar; the geometric mean dust lead levels after renovation activities
performed in accordance with the proposed rule exceeded 250 μg/ft2 only where power planing or a high
temperature heat gun were used. When baseline practices were used, the geometric mean dust lead levels
on the windowsills exceeded 250 μg/ft2 for kitchen cabinet removal, window replacement, high
temperature heat gun use, and power planing.
Exterior renovation activities performed as part of the study included the following:
 Replacing a door and doorway.
 Replacing fascia boards, soffits, and other trim.
 Removing paint with a high temperature (greater than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint with a low temperature (less than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint by dry scraping.
 Removing paint with a needle gun.
 Removing paint with power sanding or grinding.
 Removing paint with a torch or open flame.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-5
For the exterior jobs, plastic sheeting was placed on the ground to catch the debris and dust from the job,
in accordance with the requirements of the proposed rule. Additional plastic sheeting was laid out beneath
and beyond the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays to collect dust and debris were placed on top of and
underneath the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays were also placed just outside of the ‘‘proposed rule’’
plastic to assess how far the dust was spreading. A vertical containment, as high as the work zone, was
erected at the end of the additional plastic.
The use of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic as a ground covering captured large amounts of leaded dust. For
all job types except removing paint with a torch, there was a substantial difference between the amount of
lead captured by the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic and the amount under the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic.
Including both bulk debris and dust, geometric mean lead levels in exterior samples from the collection
trays on top of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic ranged from a low of 60,662 μg/ft2 for the door replacement
activity to a high of 7,216,358 μg/ft2for removing paint with a high temperature heat gun. Geometric
mean lead levels from the collection trays under the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic ranged from a low of 32
μg/ft2 for door replacement to 8,565 μg/ft2 for removing paint with a torch.
The 2008 final LRRP rule was supported by the Dust Study discussed above. Therefore, EPA conducted a
peer review in accordance with OMB’s Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. EPA
requested this review from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) Lead Review Panel.
The CASAC, which is comprised of seven members appointed by the EPA Administrator, was
established under the Clean Air Act as an independent scientific advisory committee. The CASAC’s
comments on the Dust Study, along with EPA’s responses, have been placed into the public docket for
this action. More information on the CASAC consultation process, along with background documents, is
available on EPA’s website at http://www.epa.gov/ lead/pubs/casac.htm.
According to the peer review report, the CASAC Panel found
“. . .that the [Dust Study] was reasonably well-designed, considering the complexity of the
problem, and that the report provided information not available from any other source. The study
indicated that the rule cleaning procedures reduced the residual lead (Pb) remaining after a
renovation more than did the baseline cleaning procedures. Another positive aspect of the Dust
Study was that it described deviations from the protocol when they occurred. “
The CASAC Panel also contended that the limited data from residential housing units and child-occupied
facilities included in the Dust Study, most likely do not represent a statistically valid sample of housing at
the national level. They noted that there are aspects of the study that would underestimate the levels of
lead-loadings while other aspects of the study would overestimate the loadings. EPA agrees that the Dust
Study is not nationally representative of all housing. EPA notes that there are several reasons why this is
the case, including the fact that all of the housing studied was built during 1925 or earlier, and a large
number of the floors were in poor condition. A major purpose of the Dust Study was to assess the
proposed work practices. A statistically valid sample of housing at the national level is not needed to
assess the work practices. If anything, the Dust Study is conservative with respect to the age of housing
because it studied older houses and therefore is appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the work
practices.
3.2 Regulatory Background
This section outlines the extensive history of lead-based paint regulations at the federal level. Childhood
lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the United States.
Most children with blood lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of concern have been exposed to
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-6
lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and around deteriorating older housing
(CDC 2004). The nature and extent of the problems associated with lead-based paint in housing units
have been thoroughly investigated. Approximately 40% of all U.S. housing units (about 38 million
homes) have some lead-based paint. Use of lead safe work practices during renovation can advance the
goal of primary prevention of lead poisoning (CDC 2004).
The Federal Lead-based Paint Program.
Title X and the Federal goal
Primarily in response to the persistent health threat posed by lead-based paint, in 1992 Congress enacted
Title X. Congress found that low-level lead poisoning was widespread among American children,
affecting, at that time, as many as 3 million children under age 6; that the ingestion of household dust
containing lead from deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint was the most common cause of lead
poisoning in children; and that the health and development of children living in as many as 3.8 million
American homes was endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-
contaminated dust in their homes. Congress determined that the prior Federal response to this crisis was
insufficient and established, in Title X, a national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards as
expeditiously as possible. Congress decided that the Federal government would take a leadership role in
building the infrastructure necessary to achieve this goal.
The stated purposes of Title X are:
 To develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint
hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible.
 To reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on
a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation’s
housing stock.
 To encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable
framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current
confusion over reasonable standards of care.
 To ensure that the existence of lead-based paint hazards is taken into account in the development
of Government housing policies and in the sale, rental, and renovation of homes and apartments.
 To mobilize national resources expeditiously, through a partnership among all levels of
government and the private sector, to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for
evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards.
 To reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing owned, assisted, or transferred by the
Federal Government.
 To educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead-based paint poisoning and steps
to reduce and eliminate such hazards (Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of
1992).
EPA’s lead-based paint program
Under Title X, EPA is directed to take actions that can be divided into 4 key categories:
 Establishing a training and certification program for persons engaged in lead-based paint
activities, accrediting training providers, establishing work practice standards for the safe,
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-7
reliable, and effective identification and elimination of lead-based paint hazards, and developing a
program to address exposure to lead-based paint hazards from renovation and remodeling
activities.
 Ensuring that, for most housing constructed before 1978, lead-based paint information flows from
sellers to purchasers, from landlords to tenants, and from renovators to owners and occupants.
 Establishing standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil.
 Providing information on lead hazards to the public, including steps that people can take to
protect themselves and their families from lead-based paint hazards. Each of these categories is
discussed in more detail in the following sections.
a. Training and certification, accreditation, and work practice standards. Title X added a new title to
TSCA entitled ‘‘Title IV Lead Exposure Reduction.’’ Most of EPA’s responsibilities for addressing lead-
based paint hazards can be found in this title, with section 402 being one source of the rulemaking
authority to carry out these responsibilities. TSCA section 402(a) directs EPA to promulgate regulations
covering lead-based paint activities to ensure persons performing these activities are properly trained, that
training programs are accredited, and that contractors performing these activities are certified. These
regulations must contain standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account
reliability, effectiveness, and safety.
On August 29, 1996, EPA promulgated final regulations under TSCA section 402(a) governing lead-
based paint inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, and abatements in target housing (U.S.
EPA 1996). TSCA section 401 defines ‘‘target housing’’ as any housing constructed prior to 1978,
except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age
resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-
bedroom dwelling. These regulations also apply to ‘‘child-occupied facilities,’’ which are defined at 40
CFR 745.223 as buildings constructed before 1978, or portions of such buildings, where children under
age 6 are regularly present. TSCA section 402 defines lead-based paint activities in target housing as
inspections, risk assessments and abatements. The 1996 regulations cover lead-based paint abatement
activities in target housing and child-occupied facilities, along with limited screening activities called lead
hazard screens. The regulations also established an accreditation program for training providers and a
certification program for individuals and firms performing these activities. Training providers who wish
to provide lead-based paint training for the purposes of the Federal lead-based paint program must be
accredited by EPA. Implementing regulations at 40 CFR 745.225 describe in detail the requirements for
each course of study, how training programs must be operated, and the process for obtaining
accreditation. Training programs must have a training manager with experience or education in a
construction or environmental field, and a principal instructor with experience or education in a related
field and education or experience in teaching adults. Training programs must also have adequate facilities
and equipment for delivering the training. To become accredited, an application for accreditation must be
submitted to EPA on behalf of the training program. The application must either include the course
materials and syllabus, or a statement that EPA model materials or materials approved by an authorized
State or Tribe will be used. The application must also include a description of the facilities and
equipment that will be used, a copy of the test blueprint for each course, a description of the activities and
procedures that will be used during the hands-on skills portion of each course, a copy of the quality
control plan, and the correct amount of fees. If EPA finds that the program meets the regulatory
requirements, it will accredit the training program for 4 years. To maintain accreditation, the training
program must submit an application and the correct amount of fees every 4 years.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-8
Individuals and firms that perform inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, or abatements in
target housing or child-occupied facilities must be certified. Certification requirements and the process
for becoming certified are described in 40 CFR 745.226. A firm that wishes to become certified must
submit an application, along with the correct amount of fees, attesting that it will use only certified
individuals to perform lead-based paint activities and that it will follow the work practice standards in 40
CFR 745.227. An individual who wishes to become certified must take an accredited training course in at
least one of the certified disciplines: Inspector, risk assessor, project designer, abatement worker, and
abatement supervisor. The risk assessor, project designer, and abatement supervisor disciplines have
additional requirements for education or experience in a construction or environmental field. The
inspector, risk assessor, and abatement supervisor disciplines also require the applicant to pass a
certification examination administered by a third party.
The regulations at 40 CFR part 745, subpart L, also contain work practice standards for performing
inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments and abatements in target housing and child-occupied
facilities. The regulations contain specific requirements for conducting paint sampling during an
inspection and specify information that must be gathered and samples that must be taken as part of a lead
hazard screen or risk assessment. The requirements for abatements are also set forth in the regulations.
When conducting abatements, an occupant protection plan must be prepared by a certified supervisor or
project designer; certain work practices such as open-flame burning, machine sanding or abrasive blasting
without high-efficiency exhaust control, dry scraping, and heat guns at high settings are prohibited; and a
visual inspection and dust clearance sampling must be performed after the abatement is finished to ensure
that the area is ready for re-occupancy. Any samples collected during any of these regulated lead-based
paint activities must be analyzed by a laboratory recognized by EPA as being capable of analyzing paint
chips, dust, and soil for lead. Requirements for inspection, lead hazard screen, risk assessment or
abatement reports are also described in this section
Recognizing the importance of States and Territories in achieving the goal of eliminating lead-based paint
hazards in housing, Congress specifically directed EPA to establish a model State program and a process
for authorizing States to operate such programs in lieu of the Federal program. Concurrently with the
subpart L rulemaking in 1996, EPA codified, at 40 CFR part 745, subpart Q, a model training and
certification program and a process for enabling States, Territories, and Tribes to apply for authorization
to administer their own lead-based paint activity programs. Providing Indian Tribes with this opportunity
is consistent with EPA’s Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian
Reservations (U.S. EPA 1984). EPA also provides grants under TSCA section 404 to States, Territories,
and Tribes to assist them in developing and administering these programs, as well as programs
implementing TSCA section 406(b). On June 9, 1999, the subpart L regulations were amended to include
a fee schedule for training programs seeking EPA accreditation and for individuals and firms seeking
EPA certification (U.S. EPA 1999). These fees were established as directed by TSCA section 402(a)(3),
which requires EPA to recover the cost of administering and enforcing the lead-based paint activities
requirements in unauthorized States. The most recent amendment to the subpart L regulations occurred
on March 20, 2009 (U.S. EPA 2009).
In addition, Congress directed EPA, in TSCA section 405, to establish protocols, criteria, and minimum
performance standards for analysis of lead in paint, dust, and soil. TSCA section 405 further directed
EPA, in consultation with HHS, to develop a program to certify qualified laboratories. The National Lead
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) provides the public with a list of laboratories that have met
EPA requirements and demonstrated the capability to accurately analyze paint chip, dust, or soil samples
for lead. All laboratories recognized by NLLAP must pass on-site audits conducted by one of the two
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-9
accrediting organizations currently participating in NLLAP, the American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA), and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation. Recognized laboratories must also
perform successfully on a continuing basis in the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing
(ELPAT) Program established by NIOSH, AIHA, and EPA.
More recently, the LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) and
is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was promulgated
under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of TSCA was
established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as Title X of
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The 2008 LRRP regulation requires entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
b. Lead-based paint information for purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants of target housing.
Another of EPA’s responsibilities under Title X is to require that purchasers and tenants of target housing,
as well as occupants of target housing and parents of children in COFs undergoing renovation are
provided information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards. As directed by TSCA section
406(a), CPSC, HUD, and EPA, in consultation with CDC, jointly developed a lead hazard information
pamphlet entitled ‘‘Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home’’ (‘‘PYF’’) (U.S. EPA et al 2003b).
This pamphlet was designed to be distributed as part of the disclosure requirements of section 1018 of
Title X and TSCA section 406(b), to provide home purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants with the
information necessary to allow them to make informed choices when selecting housing to buy or rent, or
deciding on home renovation projects. The pamphlet contains information on the health effects of lead,
how exposure can occur, and steps that can be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure during
various activities in the home.
Pursuant to the authority provided in section 1018 of Title X, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly
promulgated regulations requiring persons who are selling or leasing target housing to provide the PYF
pamphlet and information on known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to
purchasers and renters (HUD and U.S. EPA 1996). These joint regulations, codified at 24 CFR part 35,
subpart A, and 40 CFR part 745, subpart F, describe in detail the information that must be provided
before the contract or lease is signed and require that sellers, landlords, and agents document compliance
with the disclosure requirements in the contract to sell or lease the property. Title X does not provide for
these requirements to be administered by States or Tribes in lieu of the Federal regulations. Therefore,
HUD and EPA are responsible for administering and enforcing these disclosure obligations.
TSCA section 406(b) directs EPA to promulgate regulations requiring persons who perform home
renovations for compensation to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to owners and occupants of
target housing being renovated. These regulations, promulgated on June 1, 1998, are codified at 40 CFR
part 745, subpart E (U.S. EPA 1998). The term ‘‘renovation’’ is defined, at 40 CFR 745.83, as the
modification of any existing structure, or portion of a structure, that results in the disturbance of painted
surfaces. Lead-based paint abatement projects are specifically excluded, as are small projects that disturb
2 square feet or less of painted surfaces, emergency projects, and renovations affecting components that
have been found to be free of lead-based paint, as that term is defined in the regulations, by a certified
inspector or risk assessor. Like the regulations regarding disclosure during sales or leases, these
regulations require the renovation firm to document compliance with the requirement to provide the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-10
owner and the occupant with the PYF pamphlet. One important difference from the disclosure
requirements in section 1018 of Title X is that TSCA section 404 allows States to apply for, and receive
authorization to administer, the TSCA section 406(b) requirements. Two States are currently authorized
to operate this program.
c. Standards for lead in paint, dust, and soil. Another responsibility assigned to EPA by Title X is the
development of standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil. These standards,
promulgated pursuant to TSCA section 403 on January 5, 2001 and codified at 40 CFR part 745, subpart
D, provide various Federal agencies, including HUD, and State, local and Tribal governments with
uniform benchmarks on which to base decisions on remedial actions to safeguard children and the public
from lead-based paint hazards (U.S. EPA 2001b). These standards also allow certified inspectors and risk
assessors to easily determine whether a particular situation presents a lead-based paint hazard and whether
to recommend remedial actions such as lead-based paint abatement, cleaning of dust, or removal of soil.
The standards define lead-based paint hazards in target housing and child-occupied facilities as paint-lead,
dust-lead, and soil-lead hazards. A paint-lead hazard is defined as any damaged or deteriorated lead-
based paint, any chewable lead-based painted surface with evidence of teeth marks, or any lead-based
paint on a friction surface if lead dust levels underneath the friction surface exceed the dust-lead hazard
standards. A dust-lead hazard is surface dust that contains a mass-per-area concentration of lead equal to
or exceeding 40 micrograms per square foot (µg/ft2) on floors or 250 µg/ft2on interior windowsills based
on wipe samples. A soil-lead hazard is bare soil that contains total lead equal to or exceeding 400 parts
per million (µg/g) in a play area or average of 1,200 parts per million of bare soil in the rest of the yard
based on soil samples.
d. Public outreach and education. Among other things, TSCA section 405(d) directs EPA, along with
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and HUD, to sponsor public education
and outreach activities to increase public awareness of the health effects of lead, the potential for
exposures, the importance of screening children for elevated blood lead levels, and measures that can be
taken to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards. Accordingly, EPA has worked to provide the
public with information and increase public awareness of such matters. To date, these activities have
included web site management, development of public outreach strategies, development of partnership
agreements, distribution of materials, participation in national conferences and exhibits, and developing
hazard information documents (and other media, such as videos), as necessary to implement Title X. EPA
has collaborated closely with other Federal agencies and its State, Tribal, and local government partners
in developing outreach campaigns. EPA has also been involved in developing model tool kits of various
educational tools to provide to partners, such as slogans and graphic materials for public buses, trains, and
mass transit stations.
TSCA section 405(e) further directs EPA to establish, in connection with HUD, CDC, other Federal
agencies, and State and local governments, a clearinghouse for information on lead-based paint and a
hotline for the public to use for questions and requests for information on lead-based paint. This
clearinghouse, the National Lead Information Center, handles approximately 50,000 calls per year, and
disseminates up to 500,000 documents per year to the public.
Lead-based paint programs at other Federal agencies
In addition to EPA, other Federal agencies have important roles in achieving the goals of reducing or
eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing. Other agencies specifically assigned tasks in Title X
include HUD, CDC, and OSHA.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-11
The Federal agencies have long realized that they must work together to develop and implement Federal
strategies for addressing lead-based paint hazards in order to be efficient and effective. In 1989, HUD
and EPA formed an inter-agency task force to work through issues associated with lead-based paint
abatement. The Federal Interagency Lead Based Paint Task Force has remained active throughout the
years and continues to meet on a quarterly basis. Participating agencies include the Department of
Defense, the Veterans Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
U.S. Public Health Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the National
Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), ATSDR, CDC, CPSC, NIOSH, OSHA, HUD, and
EPA. This Task Force serves as an important forum for coordinating the strategic plans of the Federal
agencies who have responsibilities under Title X or who have responsibilities for maintaining and
disposing of property that may contain lead-based paint.
Title X assigned certain responsibilities to HUD. One of HUD’s functions is the administration of the
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program established by the Act. This program provides grants of
$1 million to $3 million to State and local governments for control of lead-based paint hazards in
privately owned, low-income owner-occupied and rental housing that is not receiving federal assistance.
These grants are also designed to stimulate the development of a trained and certified hazard evaluation
and control industry. Evaluation and hazard control work funded by the program must be conducted by
either contractors who are certified by EPA or an EPA-approved State or Tribal program, or by
contractors trained in lead-safe work practices, in the case of interim controls. Through these
requirements, HUD hopes to create infrastructure that will last beyond the life of the grant. In awarding
grants, HUD promotes the use of cost-effective approaches to hazard control that can be replicated across
the nation. Since 1993, approximately $971 million has been awarded to over 200 local and State
jurisdictions across the country. The work approved to date will lead to the control of lead-based paint
hazards in more than 70,000 homes where young children reside or are expected to reside. Other HUD
lead grant programs include the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration program, the Lead Elimination
Action Program (LEAP), the Lead Outreach program and the Lead Technical Studies program.
HUD was also given regulatory authority over some aspects of lead based paint hazard control. As noted
previously, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly promulgated regulations requiring the disclosure of
lead-based paint information during sale or lease transactions involving target housing. The HUD
disclosure regulations are codified at 24 CFR part 35, subpart A. Subparts B through R of 24 CFR part
35 are known as the ‘‘Lead Safe Housing Rule,’’ initially promulgated on September 15, 1999, and
updated in June 2004 (HUD 2004b). This rule was designed to protect young children from lead-based
paint hazards in target housing that is being sold by the Federal government or receives financial
assistance from the government. The requirements generally depend upon the level of assistance being
provided, and may include such things as inspections, risk assessments, abatement, paint stabilization, or
interim controls, which are temporary measures to reduce potential exposure to lead-based paint hazards.
The emphasis is on reducing lead-based paint hazards, so, after paint is disturbed, a visual assessment for
surface dust, debris, and residue and dust clearance testing is required to ensure that no dust lead hazards
were created or left in the work area or, for rehabilitation projects of moderate or substantial scope, in the
entire housing unit. More information on the Lead Safe Housing Rule is available on the HUD website at
http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead.
Section 1017 of Title X required HUD to issue ‘‘guidelines for the conduct of federally supported work
involving risk assessments, inspections, interim controls, and abatement of lead-based paint hazards.’’ In
response to this directive, HUD completed the Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-12
Paint Hazards in Housing (Guidelines), in June 1995 (HUD 1995). The Guidelines provide detailed,
comprehensive, technical information on how to identify lead-based paint hazards in housing and how to
control such hazards safely and efficiently.
Other core activities of HUD’s lead-based paint program include providing technical assistance to
housing authorities, nonprofit housing providers, local and State agencies, other Federal agencies, housing
developers, inspectors, real estate professionals, contractors and financiers, and public health authorities;
evaluating the hazard reduction methods used in the grant program to measure their effectiveness, cost
and safety; and maintaining a community outreach program in coordination with the other Federal
agencies involved in lead-based paint hazard reduction.
CDC also provides significant funding for the prevention of childhood lead poisoning. CDC provides
funding to support State, city and county programs in the areas of primary prevention, case management
and screening, surveillance, strategic partnerships, and program evaluation. Since 2002, CDC has
recommended that a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) be used as a threshold for
individual intervention (CDC 2002). Additional CDC recommendations address the type and intensity of
individual intervention strategies that should be undertaken, depending upon the child’s blood lead level.
These strategies range from nutritional and educational interventions, along with more frequent testing,
for a child with a blood lead level of 10–14 µg/dL, to medical and environmental interventions for
children with blood lead levels above 45 µg/dL (CDC 2002). CDC has established a national surveillance
system for children with elevated blood lead levels. In addition, CDC works with HUD and EPA to
coordinate outreach and education campaigns.
OSHA is another agency with regulatory authority under Title X. As directed by the Act, OSHA
promulgated an interim final standard on May 4, 1993, which regulates lead exposures in the construction
industry (OSHA 1993). This standard, codified at 29 CFR 1926.62, limits worker exposures to 50
micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8–hour workday. Employers must use a
combination of engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure as much as
possible, using appropriate respiratory protection where necessary to achieve the exposure limit.
Employees must receive training on the health effects of lead and how to limit exposure through proper
work practices and personal protective equipment. Exposure monitoring and medical monitoring,
including blood lead testing, are also required. This standard remains in effect and OSHA retains the
authority to protect workers from occupational exposure to lead.
Many Federal agencies have been working to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards in housing and
to end lead poisoning. EPA, HUD, and other Federal agencies have been working for many years on the
problem of lead-based paint hazards that can be created during renovation and remodeling activities in
housing and child-occupied facilities. This rulemaking is an important component of the Federal strategy
for eliminating lead poisoning.
3.3 Justification for Federal Regulations of Lead Exposure during Renovation
3.3.1 Market Failure
From an economic perspective, a necessary condition for regulations is the existence of inefficiency in the
allocation of resources. This inefficiency is commonly labeled a market failure since the market is the
mechanism assumed to make efficient resource allocations possible. A market failure can come from one
or more of several sources. These include poorly defined property rights (such as negative externalities,
common property resources, and public goods); imperfect markets for trading property rights (because of
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-13
a lack of perfect information or of contingent markets; monopoly power; distortionary taxes and subsidies
and other inappropriate government regulations); and the divergence of private and social discount rates.
The occurrence of any of these conditions justifies further inquiry into the need for government regulation
to reduce inefficiencies in the allocation of society’s resources. This section considers whether any of
these conditions are linked to lead exposures resulting from renovation in target housing and public or
commercial building COFs. If so, understanding the nature of the inefficiencies involved facilitates the
design of more effective regulations. The specific regulatory approach considered here involves the
removal of the opt-out provision (currently available for renovations in owner-occupied target housing
where no child under the age of 6 or pregnant woman resides and no COF operates), and a requirement
that renovators provide owners and occupants with information documenting compliance with the training
and work practice requirements of the LRRP rule.
Economic efficiency suggests that “lead-safe” renovation will occur as long as the property owners’
willingness-to-pay for reduced lead risks exceeds the cost of reducing these risks. If the property owners
are aware of the risks and of the availability and costs of reducing these risks, then arguably they might be
able to accurately trade off risk and cost without the aid of government regulation. However, there are
two arguments for why individual property owners may not trade off risk and cost efficiently.
Externalities and Public-Good Characteristics of Lead-Safe Renovation
A major cause of failure in the market for lead-safe renovations stems from externalities due to
renovations disturbing lead-based paint that do not use lead-safe work practices because they occur in
target housing units eligible for the opt-out provision. An efficient outcome is achieved when the
marginal willingness-to-pay for a service is equivalent to the marginal cost of providing that service.
Because the use of lead-safe work practices is likely to benefit not only the consumer of the renovation
(the homeowner and his or her family members) but also residents of adjacent properties, future
occupants, visitors, and children receiving child care on the premises, lead-safe renovation services are, in
part, a public good. As such, even with perfect information, the maximum amount that the individual
consumer of the renovation would be willing to pay for lead-safe work is likely to be lower than the total
amount that that particular consumer plus the other beneficiaries (neighbors, future occupants, etc.) would
be willing-to-pay for the service. For example, occupants of neighboring properties may also experience
an increased exposure to lead and may be willing to pay to reduce or eliminate this exposure but may not
be consulted by the property owner making the decision. As another example, children do not testify to
their willingness-to-pay for risk reduction and rely on their parents’ or the property owners’ willingness-
to-pay. Even if other parties were consulted, the transaction costs of reaching an agreement would be
high, so that this would be an inefficient process.
An example of an externality can be found in an owner’s decision about which contractor to hire to
perform renovation in his or her housing unit. Contractors that provide lead-safe renovation services are
likely to charge more for their work than establishments that do not use lead-safe practices. Lead-safe
work practices may also increase the duration of the project because contractors need to take additional
steps to prevent the spread of lead dust. Since the property owner pays for the renovation, but not
necessarily for the consequences of all the resulting lead exposure, he or she is faced with powerful short-
term incentives (lower cost and a faster turn-around) to hire a contractor that does not use lead-safe work
practices. Other parties (such as residents of adjacent properties, future occupants, visitors, and children
receiving child care and their parents) pay for the consequences of lead exposures, not the property
owner. This externality results in a socially inefficient outcome of too little lead-safe renovation services
being purchased.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-14
A similar external cost problem also leads to inefficiencies on the supply side of this market. Renovators
that use lead-safe work practices incur higher costs than other contractors who are faced with the
incentives to keep their costs as low as possible. Similar to property owners, contractors may not incur
the costs of consumer lead exposure resulting from unsafe renovation work.
Because the legal/liability system is not perfect, the contractor’s financial responsibilities (in terms of
costs related to the customer’s lead exposure) are not clear and consistently enforced. The same situation
occurs with respect to a property owner’s responsibilities to residents of adjacent properties, future
occupants, visitors, and child-care customers. This is likely to result in an inefficient outcome of either
too little lead-safe renovation services being consumed.
Inadequate Information
Another cause of failure in the market for lead-safe work practices is due to inadequate information.
Correct information is an important prerequisite to the demand for containment and clean-up practices
that reduce lead exposure during renovation projects. In deciding whether lead-safe work practices or
well-trained contractors are worth the extra cost, the property owner has to know whether there is lead in
the work area, what risks are implied by having renovation done in areas with lead-based paint, the
significance of these risks, what can be accomplished in reducing those risks through specific
containment and clean-up practices, and how much these practices cost.
Misinformation can lead to inefficient outcomes. Without knowing there is a lead problem, or how
renovation might create lead hazards, the owner will have too low a demand for proper work practices
and may be unwilling to pay additional costs for contractors who voluntarily abide by these containment
and clean-up standards. Furthermore, a great deal of uncertainty can exist if the consumer is unsure about
the quality of lead-safe renovation services being purchased and their likely benefits. If consumers do not
have any guarantee that contractor are qualified to identify and control lead-based paint hazards, demand
for these services is likely to be lower than in the presence of such a guarantee. On the supply side,
contractors may be unaware of the risks they are creating and the methods they can use to reduce risks of
lead exposure.
Impacts of the Regulation on Demand for Lead-Safe Renovation Services in Opt-out Housing
A consumer’s demand for renovation services is a function of the price of these services, the
characteristics of the services (e.g., quality, lead safety etc.), and the characteristics of consumers.
Assume that all renovation services are identical except that some are performed using lead-safe
containment and clean-up practices and some are not. Assume for illustration purposes that there is only
one consumer and one supplier in the market. Of the services that are performed not using these lead-safe
practices, some are done by the supplier, while others are do-it-yourself projects performed by the
consumer. The general market failure relationships discussed above are illustrated in Exhibit 3-1 as three
markets for close substitutes. Figure (a) represents the market for lead-safe renovation projects, Figure
(b) represents the professional market for “standard practice” renovations that do not use lead-safe work
practices, and Figure (c) represents the do-it-yourself market for “standard practice” renovations. In each
market, S0 represents the supply of renovation services and D0 represents the demand for renovation
services in the baseline with incomplete information. Note that, moving from left to right, each supply
curve is lower than the prior one, corresponding to the lower cost in terms of materials and time
combined. The area under the demand curve in each market represents the consumer’s willingness-to-pay
for renovation services.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-15
Exhibit 3-1: Impact of Regulation on Markets for Renovation/Remodeling Services in Opt-out Housing
The LRRP program alters the nature of these three markets by providing information to the consumer and
contractor about the risk associated with lead-based paint renovation activities and by requiring lead-safe
containment and clean-up practices for professional projects. The implementation of the LRRP program
will help to establish a more structured market for lead-safe renovation services. Prior to the LRRP
program, consumers of renovation services generally had no guarantee that a contractor who claimed to
provide lead-safe renovation services would actually perform the project in a lead-safe manner. The
implementation of work practice standards and training/certification requirements is likely to increase
consumer confidence in the quality of the work provided by certified contractors, increasing their
willingness-to-pay for these services.
EPA’s targeted outreach program is also likely to increase demand for lead-safe renovation services by
raising consumer awareness about the dangers of unsafe work. Although contractors that currently
provide well-trained staff and perform lead-safe work practices are expected to find it in their vested
interest to provide the kinds of information cited above, this possibility has not closed the information
gaps for the public. One impediment may be public uncertainty about the reliability of information that
contractors themselves provide. Their information may be considered unreliable because consumers are
not fully competent to assess the lead contamination and what needs to be done, because the businesses
are subject to moral hazard (which occurs, for example, because businesses have a financial interest in
minimizing their work practice costs), or both. Since many property owners may lack easy access to
independent sources of information to motivate their decisions, doing nothing may be the likely response.
With the implementation of the LRRP program, however, consumers are more likely to avoid the dangers
posed by unsafe renovation and hire a qualified contractor to perform the work in a lead-safe manner.
The increased demand discussed above is shown by an upward shift of the demand curve in Figure (a)
from D0 to D1 and an associated increase in price. Simultaneously, the demand for “standard practice”
renovation services decreases with an associated decrease in price. Given scarce resources for
enforcement, it is expected that some “standard practice” professional work will continue, even in
properties where there is the potential for lead exposure. The effect of the regulation on the do-it-yourself
market is ambiguous. Some property owners that might have hired a professional to perform “standard
practice” renovation work in the baseline may decide to perform this work themselves rather than pay the
additional costs for lead-safe work practices. This would shift the supply curve back up. On the other

hand, with increased information, property owners that would have performed do-it-yourself “standard”
practice” renovation in the baseline may decide to either forgo renovation altogether or hire a lead-safe
professional, thus reducing do-it-yourself demand.
Impacts of the Regulation on the Supply of Lead-Safe Renovation Services
The regulation will increase both the costs of supplying lead-safe services and standard services. In
Figures (a) and (b), S1 represents the supply of services with the regulations. A contractor that already
uses lead-safe practices will also incur the costs of training, certification and cleaning verification. A
contractor that continues to provide standard (not lead-safe) renovation services will have higher costs of
operation due to potential enforcement actions, and potentially higher liability. The relative size of the
shifts in the two submarkets will affect the final changes in quantity and price of both lead-safe and
standard renovation services.
The net impact on the quantity of renovation projects performed is also ambiguous. If all property owners
are willing to pay the full amount for lead-safe work practices, then the total quantity performed across all
three markets will remain constant but the average price will rise. However, if some property owners are
not willing to pay for the risk reduction they may chose to forgo renovation services altogether, resulting
in a net decline in renovation services provided after regulation.1
Conclusions
As demonstrated in this review, due to inadequate information and the existence of externalities, the
quantity of lead-safe RRP services currently provided is likely to be inefficiently low. The results of the
market failures discussed in this review are significant in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
Childhood lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the
United States. During 1999 through 2002, approximately 310,000 children aged 1 to 5 years, had blood-
lead levels greater than 10 μg/dL, despite the removal of lead from gasoline and the banning of lead-based
paint in 1978 (CDC 2005). Most children with blood-lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of
concern have been exposed to lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and
around deteriorating older housing or other buildings where they spend time. According to the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), “renovation and remodeling activities that disturb lead-based paint can create
substantial amounts of lead dust in the home; such dust can then be inhaled or ingested by children”
(CDC 1997). An insufficient number of lead-based paint interventions have occurred to remove the
dangers posed by uncontrolled renovation activities; renovation activity thus continues to pose a
significant risk of lead exposure.
3.3.2 Justification for Regulation at the Federal Level
In the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X), the United States Congress
stated that the elimination of lead-based paint hazards was a national goal. Under §402, Congress
directed EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals
are properly trained, that training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaged in such activities
are certified; and to promulgate guidelines for the conduct of such renovation and remodeling activities
which may create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead. Accordingly, the 2008 LRRP rule
1 The amount by which price and quantity change in each of these markets is a function of both the amount by which
the supply and/or demand functions shift and the relative elasticities of the two functions. See Appendix 3A for
a discussion of how these factors affect the price of renovation services and the quantity provided by the
market. Appendix 3B presents price elasticity estimates for construction and RRP.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-17
established training, certification and accreditation requirements, as well as work practice requirements
for renovation work in target housing and COFs.
The proposed rule revises the LRRP program by removing the opt-out provision in the 2008 LRRP rule.
The proposed rule also requires renovation firms to provide owners and occupants with a copy of the
records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the LRRP rule.
Since both of these provisions revise the existing Federal RRP regulation, it is appropriate that the
changes be made at the Federal level, instead of the state or local level.
3.4 Approaches for Reducing Lead Exposure Resulting from Renovation
This section examines how the information provision and the mandatory training and work practice
requirements in the proposed rule address the market failures discussed in the previous section.
3.4.1 Information Provision
Information provision will occur in several ways under the LRRP program, in conjunction with other
sections of Title X. Consumers will be directly informed about lead-based paint hazards and risks
associated with renovation work through educational programs and through the expanded notification
requirements. The aim of these programs will be to educate the property owner about the risks associated
with lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards and having renovation work done in areas where these
are present, the significance of these risks, and how specific work practices can reduce those risks. In
addition, requiring training of professionals who carry out renovation projects will provide these
individuals information about the hazards of lead exposure and the use of appropriate procedures to
reduce exposure during their work. Similarly, the entity certification process will act as an indirect form
of information provision to the consumer by assuring them that the services they are purchasing will
reduce or eliminate lead exposure.
The proposed rule addresses the market failure due to inadequate information in two ways. First,
removing the opt-out provision will bring renovations in these housing units under the purview of the
LRRP program, which assures consumers that firms are certified and renovation staff are trained and
qualified to minimize exposure to lead-based paint hazards created during renovations. Second, requiring
renovators to provide owners and occupants with a record of the steps taken to comply with the
requirements of the LRRP program (using the checklist or other means) can facilitate a review and
discussion between the parties of how well the renovator complied with the work practice requirements in
the LRRP program. Both of these information provision activities are described below.
Effect of Removing the Opt-Out Provision
The objective of removing the opt-out provision is to reduce exposure to lead dust generated by
renovation projects and thereby protect children and adults from the health hazards posed by lead. Due to
the nature of the problem, uncertainty currently exists on the part of consumers about the quality of lead-
safe renovation services and their likely benefits. The lack of information regarding the benefits of and
the lack of confidence in the quality of a good or service generally leads to a lower demand and a lower
willingness-to-pay for that good or service. Thus, if consumers of renovation services are not aware of
the dangers posed by lead dust generated during renovation, or if they are not confident that a contractor
who claims to use lead-safe work practices has been properly trained, they may not be willing to pay the
additional costs of contractors who voluntarily abide by these work practice standards. Removing the
opt-out provision will bring renovations in these housing units under the purview of the LRRP program,
which assures consumers that firms are certified and renovation staff are trained and qualified to
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-18
minimize exposure to lead-based paint hazards created during renovations. This provision of information
will act as an important instrument in alleviating the problems contributing to undue lead exposure. An
example of the market failure stemming from inadequate information is presented in the previous section
and is shown graphically in Exhibit 3-1.
An additional information flow will occur under these regulations. The teaching of safe work practices to
contractors and other personnel performing RRP work in opt-out housing will provide them with
information they need to undertake renovation activities in ways that will minimize exposure to the
occupants of the building and others. The training course will also provide information about the hazards
associated with lead and renovation activities, which contractors will pass along to their clients. This
provision of information is likely to increase the demand for lead-safe work practices and assist in
eliminating the market failure that currently exists due to incomplete or misinformation.
Effect of Requiring Checklist Provision
The proposed rule’s requirement for renovators to provide the owner and occupant with a record of the
steps taken to comply with the requirements of the LRRP program is one of several information provision
requirements under Title X. For example, the proposed rule will function in conjunction with EPA’s pre-
renovation education rule, promulgated under TSCA section 406(b), that requires renovators to provide
owners and occupants of target housing and COFs with a lead hazard information pamphlet before
conducting renovations. The pamphlet that renovators must provide (entitled Renovate Right: Important
Lead Hazard Information for Families, Child Care Providers and Schools) covers topics including the
potential health effects resulting from lead exposure; how to prepare for a renovation; the work practices
that contractors must follow (containment, cleaning, cleaning verification, etc.); and what to look during
the job and after the job is done.
The proposed rule requires renovators to provide a copy of the checklist (or other information
documenting the steps taken to comply with the requirements of the LRRP program) when the final
invoice for the renovation is delivered, or within 30 days of the completion of the renovation, whichever
is earlier. Because the owner will receive the information prior to making the final payment for the work,
he or she can use this information in a discussion with the renovator about any differences between the
work practices required in the rule and those identified on the checklist as having been completed, or
between the work practices that the renovator identified on the checklist and those that the owner
observed being used. If there were any deficiencies in the contractor’s work practices, the two parties
may then be able to negotiate a resolution to address them. For example, if the renovator failed to
appropriately contain the work area, he or she may agree to have the dust levels checked through dust
wipe sampling, and (depending on the results) to perform additional cleaning in order to decrease dust
lead levels. Or owners may want to perform additional cleaning on their own.
In situations where the occupant is not the owner (i.e., in a rental unit), the occupant may be in a better
position than the homeowner to note whether the renovator followed all of the steps noted on the
checklist. Because the renovator also provides the occupant with a copy of the checklist, the occupant
can raise with the owner any discrepancies between what the occupant observed and what the completed
checklist says. The owner can then take the steps outlined above.
Requiring the renovator to provide the owner and occupant with a record of the steps taken to comply
with the LRRP program creates an additional incentive for the renovator to comply. A renovator is more
likely to adhere to all of the work practice requirements knowing that a consumer with a copy of the
completed checklist will be in a better position to evaluate whether the work followed the requirements.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-19
A mandatory information provision requirement is useful for renovators as well as consumers, since it
provides renovators with an affirmative indication that they have followed the work practice requirements
in the rule. Having the option of using a checklist developed and suggested by EPA (instead of using a
checklist that has been developed by private parties) may address possible questions of whether the
checklist renovators are using is sufficient and appropriate.
EPA’s version of the checklist is short (one page long) and is written in simple and clear language. The
information provided by the renovator is supplied in checkboxes or in short fill-in-the-blank answers.
Thus, the information is provided in a format the owners and occupants can readily understand. Because
renovators must provide the checklist prior to final payment for the work, owners will receive the
information in a timely fashion. This provides them with the ability to act on the information in an
appropriate manner.
If renovators were not mandated to provide this information to consumers, responsible renovators might
theoretically provide it voluntarily (although renovators who are not as responsible are unlikely to provide
this information voluntarily). But there is no evidence that even responsible renovators are doing this.
EPA’s analyses for this rule and for the 2008 LRRP rule assumes that some of the work practices required
by the LRRP program are already used in a fraction of the renovations in the baseline (that is, without the
LRRP program applying). If renovators were interested in voluntarily providing consumers with
information similar to that on the checklist, then presumably some of them would already be doing it (i.e.,
providing consumers with documentation of the types of containment, cleaning, and other work practices
they are using in the baseline). However, there has been no indication that renovators are providing
owners with documentation of the work practices used, much less that renovators are providing
documentation comparing the work practices used with the suite of work practices required by the LRRP
program. The failure of the marketplace to provide this information on its own means that owners and
occupants may not be able to react appropriately to avoid or prevent risks from lead-based paint.
The proposed rule does not require owners and occupants to read the checklist or to take further actions to
reduce lead-based paint hazards. Thus, the extent to which lead exposure is reduced (beyond the expected
increase in the compliance rate discussed above) depends upon how participants in the transaction
respond to the information provision required by the proposed rule. Neither the costs nor benefits of these
responses can be quantified because doing so would require predicting the behavior of the parties, which
is influenced by many factors unique to each individual situation. Data are not available to estimate the
behavior changes.
3.4.2 Mandatory Training and Work Practice Requirements
The information provision described above will aid in reducing the extent of the market failure that
currently exists for lead-safe renovation services. However, relying solely on information provision is
unlikely to be sufficient to correct the market failure because of the nature of the lead paint problem. The
lead in lead-based paint cannot be seen on visual inspection, so the owner and occupant do not know if
lead is present and whether a lead exposure hazard exists. Likewise, the adverse health effects are not
noticeable for several years, and the source may not be recognized. In such situations, education may not
be sufficient and other mechanisms are needed to ensure that if a potential risk exists, it is suitably
addressed. The LRRP program introduces other mechanisms for the elimination of lead-based paint
hazards during renovation work. These include training requirements for personnel engaged in
renovation work, and the use of standard practices for the containment and cleanup of lead dust and debris
generated during the project, and the prohibition or restriction of certain high-hazard techniques. The rule
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-20
requires the use of these work practices in all target housing by removing the opt-out provision from the
LRRP program.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-21
Appendix 3A: The Role of Elasticities in Determining the Impacts of a
Rule
EPA is often faced with deciding on a regulatory policy in the absence of good information about the
likely effects of the policy on consumers and producers. In particular, data on the own-price elasticity of
supply and demand often are uncertain. This appendix provides background information on the likely
effects of own-price elasticity of demand and supply on the outcomes of EPA’s regulatory efforts. The
bulk of the discussion focuses on the case of perfect competition, not because the majority of markets
EPA is likely to affect will exhibit competitive behavior, but simply because the theory is clearly defined
in this case. However, this appendix also examines the likely impacts of relaxing the assumption of
perfect competition. It focuses on two general classes of regulatory options: regulations that alter the
market outcome by imposing additional costs upon producers, and regulations that alter the market by
providing information to consumers.
3A.1 Elasticities of Supply and Demand
The market equilibrium for a commodity (e.g., purchasing renovation, remodeling or painting (RRP)
work that uses lead-safe work practices) is determined by the intersection of the aggregate demand and
supply curves. The aggregate demand curve depicts consumer behavior and is based on consumer income
and preferences. Likewise, the aggregate supply curve describes the behavior of producers in the market,
and is dependent upon the costs of production. At market equilibrium, the price is referred to as market
clearing. In other words, at this price, the quantity demanded by consumers and supplied by producers
are equal and neither the consumer nor producer has any incentive to move away from this steady state as
long as current demand and supply conditions prevail.
However, when demand and supply conditions do change, for example when new information causes
consumers to adjust their preferences and thus shift the demand curve, or changes in input prices affect
costs of production and shift the supply curve, the market gravitates to a new equilibrium. This new
equilibrium is represented by a new combination of market clearing price and quantity. The magnitude of
the change in price and quantity is dependent not only upon the extent of the shift in the demand or supply
curve, but also on the own-price elasticity of demand and supply for the commodity.
The own-price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the percent change in quantity demanded to
the percent change in price, and is reflected in the slope of the demand curve, similarly for the own-price
elasticity of supply. By determining the level of change in price and quantity, the elasticities of the two
curves also determine the distribution of the burden or benefit between the consumer and producer
resulting from a change in equilibrium conditions. Analyzing changes in consumer and producer
surpluses provides a means for quantifying such distributional changes.
Figure 3A-1 below provides a hypothetical example of how the effects of regulation may impact
consumer and producer surpluses. In the baseline, the supply curve is represented by S1, and producers
supply Q1 at a price P1. On all the inframarginal units supplied, producers receive a price above the cost
of production. The difference between the price and the cost of production represents the producer
surplus resulting from supplying Q1 at price P1 (triangle P1CD). Similarly, in the baseline consumers
demand quantity Q1 at price P1. For all the inframarginal units demanded, consumers would be willing to
pay more than that price and thus receive a surplus. The difference between what consumers are willing
to pay as measured by the height of the demand curve, and what they have to pay is the consumer surplus
(triangle ACP1).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-22
So what are the effects of regulation? In Figure 3A-1, the upward shift in the supply curve to S2 (say
from a rise in production costs due to the implementation of the RRP rule which requires use of the more
costly lead-safe work practices) results in a new equilibrium at the point B, with a new market price of P2
and quantity of Q2. Note that producer surplus decreases from P1CD to EBP2 and the consumer surplus
also decreases from ACP1 to ABP2. Thus, in the arbitrary case drawn in Figure 3A-1, the social costs of
the regulation are born by both consumers and producers of the pollution-generating good. This result
turns out to be a function of the way the supply and demand curves have been drawn, and the distribution
of costs between consumers and producers depends on the slope (elasticity) of the demand and supply
curves.

In general, for a given production cost increase, the more elastic the demand curve, the greater the
inability on the part of the producers to pass the additional costs of production on to the consumers. As
shown in Figure 3A-2 (a) and 3A-2 (b) below, the differing slopes of the demand curve lead to
differential impacts on the consumer and producer surplus. In Figure 3A-2 (a) demand for the good is
relatively price elastic, while in Figure 3A-2 (b) the good has a relatively inelastic demand. Notice that
when demand is less elastic, the price increase resulting from a shift in supply is greater and consumers
bear a greater share of the loss in consumer surplus. On the other hand, with a more elastic demand, the
overall price increase is smaller and the share of total costs born by producers is larger.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-23
The elasticity of demand is determined in general by the existence of suitable substitutes for a
commodity. If several commodities exist in the market that are considered to be close substitutes for each
other, then a consumer is likely to have a great deal of choice available to him while making his
consumption decision. This being the case, if the price of the commodity that he is presently consuming
happens to rise, he is easily able to reduce his current consumption level of that commodity and switch
over to consuming more of one of the substitutes. This flexibility limits the ability of the producer to pass
on the burden of the cost increase on to the consumer. Thus, the availability of close substitutes in the
market explains why the demand curve for a commodity will be relatively elastic, and why the rise in
price will be relatively small. On the other hand, if substitutes are lacking for a commodity that
experiences a price increase (and it is not a luxury good), then the consumer has little choice but to carry
on consuming similar quantities of the same product. Thus, in this situation he will have to shoulder a
larger share of the increased costs by paying a much higher price, and this rigidity in his consumption
behavior explains the inelastic nature of the demand curve for that commodity.
Recognizing that most markets are not perfectly competitive, product differentiation allows firms to
charge prices higher than marginal costs and charge different prices for similar goods. The degree to
which producers can pass on the cost of production depends heavily on the degree to which they can
convince consumers that their product is different from other products. In its limit this argument is just a
restatement of the fact that markets with lower elasticities of demand will experience higher price
increases. If “market demand” is defined to be the demand for a single brand of good, then the number of
substitutes for the good affects its demand elasticity and thus affects the degree to which the producer can
pass on cost increases. If the firm can convince consumers that the product is distinct then it in essence
lowers the elasticity of demand for its product.
The own price elasticity of supply, on the other hand, is dependent on the degree of specialization of
inputs. If the inputs are highly specialized or firms are locked into long-term contracts then firms in this
industry can be left with substantial sunk investments creating high transition costs which are reflected in
an inelastic supply curve. However, if supply is highly elastic then firms can easily switch production to
other uses and minimize the effect of the demand shock. In essence the elasticity of supply measures the
amount of resources lost or tied up indefinitely when consumption patterns change suddenly.
The EPA seeks to reduce hazards from lead-based paint by two separate pathways of regulatory impact.
First, it hopes to reduce exposure to lead-based paint by regulating the “method of production” of RRP
work in opt-out housing by establishing standards for such activities and through requiring certifications
and/or training. This is likely to result in an increase in the “costs of production” of RRP work thereby
affecting the supply curve for such activities. Second, the rule will provide information to consumers. In
this case EPA is likely to alter the market outcomes by changing the demand for products (lead-safe and
non lead-safe work practices). To the extent that the demand and supply of RRP work will be affected by
the rule, one must consider the price elasticities involved to determine the distributive impact of the rule
on consumers and producers.
An important factor on which the price elasticity will depend is the number of substitutes that exist for the
RRP service that is sought in the market. As previously explained, the greater the number of available
substitutes, the more elastic the demand and lesser the burden of a production cost increase likely to fall
on the consumer. Under this rule three classes of substitutes may be said to exist for RRP services. These
are (1) professionals using lead-safe work practices, (2) professionals using non lead-safe work practices,
and (3) the do-it-yourself jobs. Thus, a certain amount of flexibility is available to the consumer when it
comes to hiring RRP services.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-24
Currently a sizeable number of RRP firms may not necessarily be following lead-safe work practices
thereby limiting the size of the class of firms that do so. However, with the implementation of the rule, a
much larger number of firms are expected to adhere to these practices in the future, thus enlarging the size
of this class. In addition, this increase in the number of professionals using lead-safe work practices will
also have a geographical impact. Presently, the limited number of professionals who use lead-safe work
practices are concentrated in a select number of locations where state and local regulations have fostered
their development. As a result, in many parts of the country the choice of hiring “lead-safe” professionals
currently does not exist. But this situation will change as a larger number of firms switch to lead-safe
work practices once the rule come into effect.
However, if the increase in production costs from the rule is extremely high such a large transition of
firms from using lead-unsafe to lead-safe work practices may not occur. This is because the cheaper
option of using non-certified (non lead-safe work practice using) RRP workers or doing the work yourself
will limit the ability of the certified (lead-safe work practice using) professional to charge the consumer
for all or a large portion of this significant cost increase. In this situation a large number of lead-unsafe
firms may remain in existence. Thus, one may assume that as long as an appreciable difference exists
between “costs of production” of lead-safe and non lead-safe work practices, firms of both types will
continue to exist. The continued existence of firms using non lead-safe practices also depends on the
extent and effectiveness of enforcement activities. The greater the cost differential between lead-safe and
non lead-safe practices, the greater the need for enforcement activities.
In addition to the number of substitutes, the closeness of substitutes in their ability to replace one another
needs to be judged. The important question is whether RRP work done by uncertified professionals and
the do-it-yourself efforts are substantially less safe than the services of certified professionals. To the
extent an appreciable difference exists between the quality of service (in terms of preventing or reducing
lead-based paint hazards) provided by the two groups, they will not be perceived as close substitutes for
each other and their demand curves will not be as elastic as they would have been if they were considered
close substitutes. In such a situation, consumers feel that a sufficiently differentiated product is being
offered by the two groups, and thus their choice is limited.
This judgment on the degree of closeness of substitutes will to some extent depend upon the importance
that lead safety holds with the property owner compared to other priorities. To the extent that the priority
assigned to lead exposure is relatively small, the uncertified professionals and do-it-yourself jobs will
tend to be seen as closer substitutes for certified professionals, than if lead-based paint hazards are
perceived as a larger threat by the property owner. Thus, the elasticity of demand will also vary according
to owner priorities, and in this regard, the informational aspect of the rule may in fact assist in raising
more awareness, resulting in lead safety being assigned a higher priority.
Of a related nature, the firm certification aspect of the rule is likely to increase consumer ability to
differentiate between the services being offered by the three classes of substitutes. The certification
process will create a distinct divide which will permit the property owner to get a better appreciation of
the varied benefits to be gained from the alternatives at hand. This is likely to reduce to some extent the
perceived closeness of the substitutes and thereby make the demand more inelastic for each class of RRP
service.

3A.2 How Price Elasticity of Demand Affects the RRP Rule
As discussed above, EPA foresees two separate pathways by which the rule will take effect; increasing
costs of production leading to a shift in supply and provision of information to consumers leading to a
shift in demand. The way these two effects will play out and the role that price elasticities will play in the
adjustment of prices and quantities under the two scenarios is discussed below.
3A.2.1 Effect of Rule on the Cost of Production (Supply Shift)
EPA seeks to reduce exposure to lead-based paint hazards by the introduction of lead-safe work practices
during RRP work. These practices involve the use of increased precautions in situations where lead-based
paint hazards may potentially be created during RRP work, and as a result costs of RRP work are likely to
increase above current levels. Since producers seek to maximize profits and in the baseline will produce
goods using the lowest-cost combination of inputs, a rule requiring producers to change their input mix
will necessarily increase the cost of production. Thus, one impact of the rule will be to increase the
production costs, leading the supply curve to shift upward and to the left.
Figures 3A-2(a) and 3A-2(b) demonstrate the distributional affects of such a hypothetical shift in supply
in markets with different elasticities of demand. The price increase is much higher (P1 to P2) and the
decrease in quantity demanded is much lower (Q1 to Q2) with a given shift in supply when demand is
less elastic (as shown in Figure 3A-2(b)) as compared to the elastic demand scenario in Figure 3A-2(a).
Thus, the consumers bear a higher share of the total social cost from the regulation (represented by the
relatively larger decrease in the consumer surplus compared to that in the producer surplus). On the other
hand, Figure 3A-2(a) shows that the higher the elasticity of demand, the lower the overall price increase,
the larger the reduction in quantity demanded, and thus the larger the share of total costs to be born by
producers (represented similarly by the larger decrease in producer surplus as compared to the consumer
surplus).
3A.2.2 Effect of Rule on the Provision of Information to Consumers (Demand Shift)
The alternative regulatory approach is to provide information to consumers in the hopes that they will
make more environmentally friendly consumption choices. In this case EPA alters the market outcomes
by changing the demand for products. Figures 3A-3(a) and 3A-3(b) depict such a hypothetical example.
In these cases the commodity in question (non lead-safe work practices) has negative environmental
effects (byproducts). By educating consumers about these byproducts and alternative products that have
lower levels of adverse effects (lead-safe work practices), EPA can change consumer preferences and
shift demand for the “bad product” inward and to the left. This lower demand curve would more
accurately reflect the true “social” marginal benefits of consuming the product.
What are the likely distributional and efficiency effects of this type of regulatory policy? Figures 3A-3(a)
and 3A-3(b) reveal that under both scenarios (for an elastic and inelastic supply curve), the downward
shift in the demand curve will lead to a decrease in price and quantity demanded of the commodity.
However, in the case of an elastic supply curve when the transition costs associated with switching to the
production of other products is relatively low, the decrease in price of the commodity is smaller and the
decrease in quantity demanded larger, as compared to the changes in the case of an inelastic supply curve
involving high transition costs. Restated in terms of changes in producer and consumer surpluses, the
producer surplus is reduced under each scenario, but the elastic supply curve causes a relatively smaller
burden to fall on the producer than the inelastic supply curve. Similarly, the consumer receives a
reduction in social benefit under each scenario; however, the magnitude of this reduction is larger under
the inelastic supply curve case.

3A.2.3 Application to Renovation
In the rule, EPA is both affecting production and providing information. The likely effects of the
regulation on prices and welfare are difficult to discuss without more accurate information on the supply
and demand elasticities. However, some general observations are warranted.
The welfare effects of the regulation will likely be driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.
This is because the elasticity of supply for RRP services is likely to be relatively higher than the elasticity
of demand. Supply elasticities are expected to be relatively high because there are relatively few barriers
to entering or leaving this industry. Little capital equipment or specialized labor skills are needed for
RRP work, and what is needed is easily transferred from non-compliant renovation to “lead-safe”
projects. On the demand side, there are two primary categories of RRP events – those of a maintenance
character and those of an improvement character. Maintenance activities usually cannot be postponed
and thus are not particularly sensitive to price. Improvement projects, however, can more easily be
postponed and thus tend to be more price elastic. Complicating matters, however, are the existence of
different categories of purchasers. Some place a high premium on quality and timeliness, while others
actively seek low prices. Appendix 3B discusses some of the empirical evidence on elasticities of
demand and supply.
However, the analysis does not suggest that the education factor is unimportant. If the regulation is not
accompanied by education efforts and enforcement, then EPA could unintentionally drive up demand for
non-compliant renovation projects creating additional welfare losses. These losses are the result of the
fact that if consumers were aware of the lead paint issues their true marginal valuation for the non-
compliant projects is lower than the price of these projects. Thus, if enforcement is not perfect, education
is essential. EPA can compensate for the fact that it is raising the costs of lead-free renovation on the
supply side by educating consumers on the environmental effects of non-compliant renovations thereby
making these cheaper, non-compliant projects less attractive.

Appendix 3B: Elasticities of Demand and Supply for Housing /
Renovation Services
As described in Chapter 3 and Appendix 3A, the impact of increases in the cost of RRP services on
demand for RRP will depend on both the size of the cost increase and the elasticity of demand for these
services. Likewise, the impact on the supply of RRP services will depend on both the size of the cost
increase and the elasticity of supply for these services. These impacts are expressed in terms of changes
in price and in the quantity of services purchased. Chapter 4 estimates the cost increases due to the
requirements of the various regulatory options, based on the increased labor and materials costs of
complying with the containment and clean-up requirements, as well as the training and certification costs
imposed by the requirements. This appendix reviews the existing literature on residential demand
elasticities.
Unfortunately, RRP has received relatively little attention by housing economists. While there are many
studies that estimate elasticities for new construction, these studies have only limited applicability to
renovation and remodeling. The income elasticity of demand for housing is generally estimated to be
somewhat inelastic (in the 1.0 to 0.8 range). This is consistent with housing being a necessity –
expenditures on housing do not increase as rapidly as income (Green and Malpezzi 2003). Demand for
housing is also considered to be somewhat price inelastic, with generally accepted values either in the
range of -0.5 to -1.0 or -0.75 to -1.2 (Mayo 1981, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001, Ellwood and Polinski
1979). One study is available that estimated a renovation demand elasticity (Gyourko and Saiz 2003).
This study found renovation demand to be very inelastic, with an elasticity estimated to be –0.28.
On the other hand, housing supply appears to be very elastic – consistent with the highly competitive
nature of the residential construction market and the large number of small contractors. Because it is very
easy to enter (and to leave) the construction business, supply is very responsive to changes in prices,
especially in the long run.2 Based on the literature surveyed, estimates of housing supply elasticities tend
to range from 1.0 to 4.0, but a couple of studies found elasticities as high as 13 or higher (DiPasquale and
Wheaton 1994, Topel and Rosen 1988, Blackley 1999, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001). No elasticity
numbers specific to the supply of renovation services could be found.
Several characteristics of RRP tend to make its demand more price elastic than the demand for housing in
general. For example:
 The existence of close substitutes to compliant RRP. These substitutes include:
 Do-It-Yourself RRP –owners of buildings may be tempted to do their own RRP work
without proper training and certification.
 Firms that do not complying with the regulations. These regulations may be difficult to
enforce against contractors, particularly the large number of small contractors who may
be hard to identify and monitor.
 Reductions in the scope of the projects, or postponement of the projects, to compensate
for the price increase. Purchasers can reduce other RRP-related costs by substituting
lower-priced fixtures/finishes and/or less extensive remodeling.
 Many RRP projects are discretionary. The price elasticity of discretionary projects is likely to be
higher than replacement projects (e.g. new roof). For discretionary RRP projects, it is relatively
2 Note – stock adjustment models give lower elasticities than flow models. Malpezzi and Maclennan (2001).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-28
easy for the purchaser to reduce the scale/scope of the project, postpone the project, or never do
it.
Offsetting these characteristics that foster higher elasticities of demand, are ones that foster lower
elasticities. The major one is that the product purchased cannot be separated from the firm providing the
product, which is true of all services. In addition to the various RRP events analyzed in the subsequent
chapters, RRP firms themselves are relatively differentiated. Some firms specialize in high-end,
complicated projects (e.g. elaborate new kitchens) while other firms specialize in performing small
routine tasks (repainting apartments at tenant turn-over). Some firms only work in historic or Victorian
homes, while others will work on any type of home. Some firms do only one type of project (e.g.
replacing siding) while other firms will do any and all types of RRP work. This differentiation results in
lower demand elasticities, because producers may not be considered particularly close substitutes.
 To the extent that lead-safe work can be distinguished from non-lead-safe work, a higher price
can be charged for it.
 Many contractors already employ lead-safe practices (or at least control the dispersion of dust and
clean well before leaving). The regulations will serve to reduce this differentiation.
Second, the nature of RRP projects may also reduce price competition. For relatively small jobs, property
owners frequently will not get multiple bids – the assumed cost of the job does not warrant the effort. In
this case, the compliance cost can be passed on without fear of losing the work. In the case of large jobs,
where owners will get bids, compliance costs will make up a relatively small proportion of the total cost
and, again, passing on the costs may be easy.
Characteristics of the purchaser of the RRP services may also affect their demand price elasticity. High-
income purchasers are likely to be less price sensitive than low-income purchasers. In addition, owners of
rental properties may be more price sensitive than owner occupants because they have different objective
functions. Owner-occupants operate so as to maximize their utility (their enjoyment of the house) and
asset growth is likely to enter their decision as a secondary factor. Owners of rental housing, on the other
hand, are assumed to be maximizing their profits. It is reasonable to expect that the optimal level of
capital of an absentee landlord’s rental building is lower than that of an owner-occupier’s house, since the
landlord’s marginal rent revenue from renovations is likely to be less than the homeowner’s marginal
utility.
Because of the lack of detailed price elasticity estimates for RRP, the analysis in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 does
not incorporate any reduction in professional RRP activities in response to the cost increases resulting
from the regulation.

4. Costs of the Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule
Revisions
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, and
(2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures.
The costs associated with the revisions to the §402(c) Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting (LRRP)
Rule are divided into four categories for the purposes of this analysis: (1) work practice costs, (2) training
costs, (3) certification costs (which include the firm’s paperwork burden and EPA administrative and
enforcement costs), and (4) recordkeeping checklist provision costs. The costs associated with the first
three components are all attributable to the elimination of the opt-out provision, which will extend the
2008 LRRP requirements to additional housing units. In addition to the work practice costs associated
with the RRP events in these housing units, this change is expected to result in more individuals and firms
seeking training and certification. The fourth component, recordkeeping checklist provision costs, applies
to all housing units regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule as well as the additional housing units that would
no longer be eligible for the opt-out provision.
The general approach of the analysis is to first estimate the number of affected activities or entities and
then estimate the incremental regulatory cost per-activity or entity affected. Finally, the incremental costs
and the number of affected activities and entities are combined to estimate the total costs. The analysis
estimates the total costs associated with the first three years of regulation and then extrapolates to the
costs of the regulation over a fifty year period—estimated with three and seven percent discount rates.
The chapter is organized as follows: Section 4.1 defines the regulatory options considered in this analysis;
Section 4.2 estimates the number of regulated renovation, repair, and painting events under the various
regulatory scenarios; Section 4.3 presents the estimated costs of using the required work practices;
Section 4.4 presents the estimated number of firms, renovators, and workers seeking training and
certification; Section 4.5 presents the incremental training costs; Section 4.6 presents the estimated
certification, administrative and enforcement cost estimates; Section 4.7 presents the recordkeeping
checklist provision cost estimates; Section 4.8 presents the total costs of the regulation; and Section 4.9
presents the total costs associated with various alternative regulatory options.
4.1 Definitions of Options
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options. The effective date for the recordkeeping
checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options. However, options A through D differ in terms of
the effective dates of the elimination of the opt-out provision. In addition, the economic analysis
considers four options with varying work practice requirements, Options E1 through E4. Table 4-1
summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both have effective dates of June 2010 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, but
Option A does not phase in the opt-out elimination while Option D limits opt-out elimination to pre-1960
structures during Phase 1 of the regulation and expands the requirements to structures built between 1960
and 1978 in Phase 2, which has an effective date of June 2011. Options B and C have effective dates of
January 2011 and June 2011 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, respectively and neither option
phases in this requirement.
Options E1 through E4, analyzed in Section 4.9, have the same effective dates and universe of regulated
structures as Option A, but consider alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same
containment requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning

verification work practices. Option E2 has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as
specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any containment work practices. Option E3 has the
same cleaning requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any containment or
cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same containment, cleaning and cleaning
verification requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not restrict or prohibit any paint
removal practices.

4.1.1 Affected Universe
The term “target housing” is defined in TSCA Section 401 as any housing constructed before 1978,
except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child under 6 resides or is expected
to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling. A child-occupied facility (COF) is defined as ‘‘a
building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, visited regularly by the same child, under the
age of six, on at least 2 different days within any week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that
each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the
combined annual visits last at least 60 hours. Child-occupied facilities may include, but are not limited
to, day-care centers, preschools and kindergarten classrooms” as follows:
 Kindergartens: Located in public and private schools.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-3
 Pre-Schools and Daycare centers: Organized (licensed) facilities located in public or
commercial buildings.
 Family daycare: Organized (licensed) daycare facilities located in the provider’s home.
 Informal daycare: Informal (i.e. not licensed) day care providers, including relatives and non-
relatives. Some of these providers may be paid for their services.
Some COFs are also target housing (e.g., daycare facilities located in the provider’s home). The 2008
LRRP rule applied to rental units, all target housing COFs, and all owner-occupied target housing units
where a child under the age of 6 resides within the vintage categories specified above. The 2008 LRRP
rule provided an opt-out provision for owner-occupied target housing units that are not COFs and where
no child under the age of 6 or pregnant woman resides. The proposed revisions to the LRRP program
include the removal of this opt-out provision and an additional requirement that the renovator provide a
copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners and occupants of renovated structures.
4.1.2 Containment, Cleaning, and Verification Standards
The containment, cleaning, and verification standards discussed in this section are the same for Options
A-D as for the 2008 LRRP rule. Options with alternative work practice are considered in section 4.9 of
this analysis.
4.1.3 Occupant protection
Under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 745.85(a)(1), work areas must be
clearly defined with signs warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to
remain outside of the work area. These signs must be posted before beginning the renovation and must
remain in place until the renovation has been completed and the work area has been verified to have been
adequately cleaned. If warning signs have been posted in accordance with HUD’s Lead Safe Housing
Rule (24 CFR §35.1345(b)(2)) or OSHA’s Lead in Construction Standard (29 CFR §1926.62(m)),
additional signs are not required by this proposal.
4.1.4 Containing the work area
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2), a firm must contain the work area so that no visible dust or debris leaves
the work area while the renovation is being performed. Containment refers to methods of preventing
leaded dust from migrating beyond the work area. It includes everything from the simple use of
disposable plastic drop cloths to the sealing of openings with plastic sheeting.
4.1.4.1 Interior renovations
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2)(ii), a firm must take the necessary work site preparation steps in order to
prevent dust and debris from leaving the work area. Renovation projects generate varying amounts of
leaded dust, paint chips, and other lead-contaminated materials depending on the type of work, area
affected, and applied work methods. For example, repairing a small area of damaged drywall would
likely generate less lead-contaminated dust and debris than sanding a large area in preparation for
painting.
4.1.4.2 Exterior renovations
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2)(ii), a firm preparing the work area for an external renovation must close all
doors and windows within and below the area undergoing renovation and to cover the ground with plastic
sheeting or other disposable impermeable material extending out from the edge of the structure a
sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris. In addition, doors within the work area that must be
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-4
used while the job is being performed must be covered with plastic sheeting to prevent dust and debris
from entering the building.
4.1.5 Waste from renovations
Renovation projects can generate a considerable amount of waste material. Lead-contaminated building
components and work area debris must be handled carefully to prevent the release of lead-contaminated
dust and debris. Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(3), a firm must contain the waste from renovation activities to
prevent releases of dust and debris before the waste is removed from the work area for storage or
disposal. If a chute is used to remove waste from the work area, it must be covered. At the conclusion of
each work day and at the conclusion of the renovation, waste that has been collected from renovation
activities must be stored under containment, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris
out of the work area and prevents access to dust and debris.
In addition, transporting lead-based paint waste in uncovered vehicles is a possible source of releases of
paint chips or dust. Therefore, lead-based paint waste from RRP activities must be transported under
containment that prevents identifiable releases (e.g., inside a plastic garbage bag).
4.1.6 Cleaning the work area
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(4), a firm must clean the work area until no visible dust, debris, or residue
remains. The firm must also conduct a more thorough, specialized cleaning, which would remove both
visible debris and dust particles too small to be seen by the naked eye.
4.1.7 Cleaning verification
Under 40 CFR §745.85(b), a firm must conduct an additional cleaning verification step following the
visual inspection. This step involves wiping the windowsills and floors with specialized cleaning cloths
and comparing them to a cleaning verification card developed and distributed, or otherwise approved, by
EPA for the purpose of determining, through comparison of disposable cleaning cloths with the card,
whether post renovation cleaning has been properly completed.
4.1.8 Exceptions
As defined in 40 CFR §745.83, minor repair and maintenance activities (including minor electrical work
and plumbing) are not considered renovations and are not subject to the work practice requirements
described above if they disrupt 6 square feet or less of a painted surface per room for interior renovations
or 20 square feet or less for exterior renovations. Such activities are only considered minor maintenance
if they do not involve prohibited or restricted practices, window replacement, or demolition of painted
surface areas.
Under 40 CFR §745.82, the work practice requirements of the rule do not apply to renovations that only
affect painted components that a certified inspector or risk assessor has determined do not contain
regulated lead-based paint (at least 1.0 mg/cm2 or 0.5% by weight lead). Furthermore, the work practice
requirements do not apply to renovations that only affect painted components that have been
demonstrated to be free of regulated lead-based paint through the use of an EPA-recognized test kit by a
certified renovator. Test kits for LBP that are currently available have false positive rates that range from
47 percent to 78 percent. EPA believes that by the end of 2010, improved test kits will be developed that
will have a false positive rate of 10 percent or less.

4.2 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting
Events
4.2.1 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting Events in
Target Housing
To achieve the rule’s objective of controlling lead exposure through containment, cleanup, and
verification, most of the compliance costs associated with the RRP rule’s work practices pertain to the
room or area where the renovation work is performed. Therefore, this analysis defines a regulated event
as any group of renovation tasks where two or more square feet of a painted surface are disturbed in a
specific room or area of a housing unit. The 2003 American Housing Survey (AHS) is the primary data
source for the estimates of regulated RRP events that occur in owner-occupied housing. The 1995
Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS) is the primary data source utilized for estimating the
number of regulated events in renter-occupied housing.
Following the methodology from the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008), event counts
are estimated separately by housing type (single-family or multi-family) and tenure of occupant (owner or
renter). The housing units affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision include both single-family
and multi-family owner-occupied units.1 Since single-family owner-occupied units have larger average
sizes compared to multi-family owner-occupied units, separate work practice compliance costs are
estimated for these two types of housing units. Since all rental units are ineligible for the opt-out
provision under the 2008 LRRP rule, no work practice costs, training costs, or certification costs are
associated with these units under the LRRP rule revision. However, recordkeeping checklist provision
costs are estimated for events in all housing types, since this provision affects both the units regulated
under the 2008 LRRP rule and the units that will be regulated under the removal of the opt-out provision.
Available renovation data do not include information specific enough to determine when a renovation
task disturbs a painted surface or when renovation tasks are performed together in the same room or area.
Thus, it was necessary to make some assumptions about which types of renovation tasks are likely to
disturb painted surfaces and which sets of tasks are likely to be performed together as part of one
renovation project. Note that the counts of exterior events for multi-family housing units are adjusted to
correspond to building-specific compliance costs. 2
4.2.1.1 Data Sources
U.S. Census: American Housing Survey
According to the U.S. Census (2005g):
The survey is conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).
The American Housing Survey (AHS) collects data on the Nation's housing including apartments, single-
family homes, mobile homes, vacant housing units, household characteristics, income, housing and
neighborhood quality, housing costs, equipment and fuels, size of housing unit, and recent moves.
National data are collected in odd numbered years. Data for each of 47 selected Metropolitan Areas are
collected currently about every six years.
1 Multi-family owner-occupied units include rental properties where the owner resides in one of the units, owner-occupied condo
units, and owner-occupied co-op units.
2 For example, when siding is replaced on the outside of a three-unit building, the analysis accounts for this as one siding
replacement event rather than the siding replacement outside of three units.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-6
The surveys utilized in this analysis, 1997 and 2003, have sample sizes of 45,932 and 55,452,
respectively. Of the housing units sampled, 33,549 and 35,996, for the 1997 and 2003 surveys
respectively, have at least one bedroom, are not public housing, receive no rent subsidies, and were built
before 1980. The 2003 AHS groups housing units built in the 1970’s as units built between 1970-74 or
1975-1979, so this analysis counts all housing units built before 1980 in the pre-1978 regulated universe.
The sample weights provided by the U.S. Census for analyzing the AHS data were designed so that
estimates using the provided sample weights would represent the national housing population. However,
the U.S. Census weights were not designed to correct for underreporting within housing units—such as
information reported on occupants living in the housing units. Since there is underreporting within-
housing units, estimates of the number of individuals calculated using the U.S. Census weights results in
lower population estimates than those estimated using other U.S. Census population data sources. In
addition, according to Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (personal communication with Kermit
Baker, August 2005), it appears that the 2003 survey labels too many housing units as vacant; these units
are actually occupied by individuals that did not respond to the survey. To correct for this bias, the Joint
Center for Housing Studies has adjusted the weights provided by the U.S. Census for the 2003 AHS.
These adjusted weights provided by the Joint Center for Housing Studies are utilized for all of the
calculations using the 2003 AHS in this analysis; population estimates calculated from the AHS are more
closely aligned with other U.S. Census population estimates when calculated with these adjusted weights.
U.S. Census: Property Owners and Managers Survey
According to the U.S. Census (2005h):
The Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS) was designed to learn more about rental housing and
its providers. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of the property owners and managers on
whom the nation depends to provide affordable rental housing and what motivates their rental and
maintenance policies. Survey interviews were conducted between November 1995 and June 1996.
A nationwide sample of approximately 16,300 housing units which were rented or vacant-for-rent in the
1993 American Housing Survey National Sample (AHS-N) was selected and a questionnaire was mailed
to the property owner, manager, or other agent of the owner of each property containing a selected unit.
Detailed information was collected on maintenance, management practices, tenant policy, financial
aspects of rental property ownership, owner characteristics, and related topics.
POMS Sample Areas
The addresses included in the POMS sample were limited to counties and independent cities in the 438
sampling areas used for the Census Bureau's 1993 American Housing Survey (AHS) National Sample.
Units Included
A unit (and the property containing the unit) was included in the survey if it was a privately owned rental
unit in the 1993 AHS-N and was still a rental at the time of the POMS (November 1995 to June 1996). A
unit was considered a rental if it was either rented for cash rent, occupied by someone other than the
owner without payment of cash rent, or vacant but available for rent.
Since the POMS survey is relatively old (1995), this analysis first calculates the percentage of rental-
housing units performing renovations according to the POMS and then applies these percentages to the
corresponding number of rental-housing units in 2003 according to calculations using the AHS. This
approach is described in greater detail in the section below.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-7
4.2.1.2 Number of Regulated Events in Owner-Occupied Housing Units
The 2003 AHS is the primary data source used for estimating the number of RRP events in owner-
occupied housing for which compliance costs will be incurred. The 1997 AHS is also used for estimating
the number of RRP events since it contains some more specific renovation information that was not
included in the 2003 survey. AHS respondents report information about the ages of householders who are
defined in the survey as persons who live or sleep there most of the time. Thus, child-occupied
households are defined as those households with a householder under the age of 6 at the time of the RRP.
Child-occupied households are estimated to be households with a householder between the ages of one
and seven at the time of the survey since it is assumed that any RRP reported occurred a year earlier (RRP
performed up to two years earlier may be reported). It follows that a household is defined as being
occupied by a pregnant woman if there is a woman of childbearing age and a child who is under the age
of one at the time of the survey. This section describes how the numbers of events are estimated from the
renovation module of the AHS and the methodology for estimating the number of Interior Painting and
Exterior Painting events using data from the (one-time) 1997 lead paint module of the AHS.
AHS Renovation Tasks
The 2003 AHS allows respondents to report 40 different renovation tasks; this analysis categorized 24 of
these 40 as tasks that may disturb more than 6 square feet or more per room of a painted surface for
interior renovations, or 20 square feet or more for exterior renovations. Since tasks performed within two
years of the survey can be reported, it is assumed that half occurred in the first year and half occurred in
the second (i.e. the total number of events counted for the two year period is divided by two). Since do-it-
yourself RRP is not covered by the rule, only tasks that are reported to be performed by professionals are
included in the analysis.
Table 4-2 lists these 24 AHS renovation tasks by their event category. Note that while the respondents do
not specifically report whether or not painted surfaces were disturbed, the survey instrument instructed
them to only include major work.3 This analysis groups the 24 AHS tasks into seven event categories
(bathroom event, kitchen event, addition event, window/door event, wall-disturbing event, whole exterior
event, contained exterior event) based on the room or area where each AHS renovation task is likely to be
performed.
When a household reported multiple tasks to AHS that fall under the same EPA event category, it is
assumed that these tasks are performed together in the same area of the housing unit. Therefore, one set
of compliance costs are assumed to apply to each event. For example, if a household reported to AHS
that they replaced their air conditioning system and replaced their heating system, this analysis assumes
that they would incur the compliance costs associated with one wall-disturbing event. Compliance costs
are dependent on the size of the work area. Thus, when a household reported a wall-disturbing task to
AHS that is not specific to a particular room as well as a room-specific task—e.g. remodeling the kitchen
(specific to the kitchen) and replacing water pipes (not room-specific)—this analysis accounts for this as
one event with a work area that includes the room in which a room-specific task was reported. However,
if a household reported tasks to AHS corresponding to multiple room-specific events (such as remodeling
the kitchen and bathroom), these are counted as separate events. .
As shown in Table 4-2 and discussed above, some tasks reported to AHS are not necessarily confined to a
specific room or area of the unit. Most of these tasks are likely to involve disturbing a wall or the ceiling
3Specifically, the survey instrument instructed respondents with the following language: “We are only interested in
jobs that were MAJOR alterations or improvements, such as rewiring, a new roof, new windows or doors. Do NOT
include minor repairs or other routine maintenance.” This analysis assumes that jobs that were not reported to AHS
would qualify for the minor maintenance exception under the LRRP rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-8
(e.g., replacing wiring or pipes); in these cases, the tasks are assigned to a wall-disturbing event. Window
or door replacement tasks are assigned to their own event category, because (as described in Section
4.2.1.5) there is a higher likelihood that windows and doors contain lead-based paint (LBP), and this
analysis accounts for the likelihood of LBP by component type.
As stated above, the 2003 AHS did not explicitly ask respondents whether a renovation task involved
disturbing a painted surface. Therefore, in order to estimate the number of events subject to the rule’s
requirements, this analysis makes assumptions about which tasks might disturb paint. In general, when a
tasked reported to AHS will sometimes involve disturbing a painted surface, it is assumed that
compliance costs are incurred each time that task is reported to AHS. For example, replacing internal
water pipes will sometimes, but not always, require disturbing painted walls to access old pipes and
replace them with new ones. However, the analysis makes no adjustment to the AHS data to account for
the instances where no painted surfaces are disturbed or when a job will qualify for the minor
maintenance exception4. Sufficient data for making such an adjustment are not available. Thus, these
assumptions may lead to an overestimate of the number of regulated events.
In the case of adding or replacing heating equipment (AHS task 58) and/or central air conditioning
equipment (AHS task 57)—Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) tasks—it is assumed that
only a fraction of these HVAC tasks require disturbing a painted surface. In addition, 18 percent of the
households reporting tasks listed in Table 4-2 to AHS reported at least one HVAC task without reporting
any other wall-disturbing task. Therefore, assuming that all HVAC work disturbs painted surfaces likely
results in a substantial overestimate of wall-disturbing events that disturb LBP and are subject to the
LRRP rule.
The percentages of HVAC tasks that are assumed to disturb painted surfaces are estimated using the 1997
AHS. Unlike the 2003 AHS, the 1997 AHS distinguishes between installing new HVAC equipment and
replacing existing equipment. Since disturbing a painted surface is most likely to occur while performing
work on the HVAC ducts (which often are behind painted walls), it is assumed that this occurs when new
systems are installed but not when existing systems are replaced.5
In addition to the seven event definitions in Table 4-2, the analysis estimates costs for Interior Painting
events and Exterior Painting events. The remodeling module of the 2003 AHS data does not cover these
types of activities but the 1997 AHS did, so data from the 1997 (one-time) lead module are utilized to
estimate the number of these events.
4 Jobs that disturb 6 square feet or less of a painted surface per room for interior renovations or 20 square feet or less for exterior
renovations; and do not involve prohibited or restricted practices, window replacement, or demolition of painted surface
areas.
5 When heating equipment work (but not air conditioning work) is reported, 7 percent and 9 percent of these tasks involve adding
a new system for single- and multi-family units, respectively. When air conditioning equipment work (but not heating work) is
reported, 36 percent and 17 percent of these tasks involve adding a new system for single- and multi-family units, respectively.
When both heating and air-conditioning equipment work is reported, 52 percent and 29 percent of the households install a new
system for single- and multi-family units, respectively.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-9
Interior Painting Events
In the 1997 AHS, respondents were asked two questions related to painting activities that are used to
estimate the number of Interior Painting events. Respondents were asked:
 Was there any painting done on the inside of the unit?
 Before painting, did anyone sand or scrape off any of the old paint?
The number of painting events involving sanding or scraping is important because painting without
sanding, scraping, or other substrate preparation does not qualify as disturbing LBP and is not subject to
the LRRP rule.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-10
In contrast with the other AHS renovation questions, respondents were not asked to specify whether the
work was performed by a professional. Thus, obtaining a count of the number of Interior Painting events
is not as simple as adding up the number of respondents that answered yes to both of these questions. It is
also necessary to estimate: (1) how many of the respondents that had painting done with sanding or
scraping hired a professional to do the work, and (2) how many of these events occur in conjunction with
other professional events reported (so the analysis does not double count if, for example, someone painted
with sanding or scraping in their kitchen and reported both painting with sanding or scraping and
remodeling their kitchen).
This analysis assumes that 44 percent of the interior painting with sanding and scraping reported in AHS
was performed by professionals. An Angie’s List (Bucksot 2006) online poll found that 44 percent of
respondents reported that they hired professionals to perform painting rather than doing it themselves.
Since Angie’s List is used to find professional contractors it seems likely that respondents would be more
likely to hire professionals than the general population. Thus, this assumption may lead to an
overstatement of the number of interior painting events that are subject to the rule.
Exterior Painting Events
This analysis assumes that exteriors of 100 percent of homes with some paint on their exterior are painted
with sanding or scraping every eight years.6 Since data on the percentage of homes with some paint on
their exteriors are not available, it is assumed that 75 percent of all pre-1978 homes have some exterior
paint; this assumption is based on data from HUD’s (2001) National Survey of Dust Lead Hazards and
Allergens in Housing, which indicates that 70 percent of pre-1960 homes have some lead paint on their
exterior. Not all pre-1960 homes have exterior paint. But of those that do, nearly all have at least some
exterior lead-based paint. Since nearly all exterior painted surfaces on pre-1960 homes are likely to have
some lead paint, it was assumed that slightly more, 75 percent, of all pre-1978 homes have exterior
painted surfaces. The annual number of Exterior Painting events is estimated as one eighth of the number
of regulated structures with exterior paint.
4.2.1.3 Number of Regulated Events in Renter-Occupied Housing Units
The 1995 POMS is the primary data source used for estimating the number of RRP events in renter
occupied housing where compliance costs will be incurred. Renter occupied units are only affected by the
additional recordkeeping checklist requirement proposed as a revision to the LRRP rule. The 1997 and
2003 AHS are also used for estimating the number of renter-occupied RRP events, since these data
contain more current estimates of the number of potentially regulated households as well as some other
information not available from the POMS.
This section first describes how the POMS data are used to obtain the annual percentage of renter-
occupied housing units where there is a regulated RRP event. Second, it describes the methods employed
for combining the percentages estimated from the POMS and the AHS data to obtain an estimate of
regulated RRP events in renter-occupied units for the first year the rule is in effect.
POMS Data
The POMS data generally has less detail then the AHS but is still the best source of renter-occupied
renovation information available. The POMS asked property owners or managers about 12 or 13 types of
maintenance and repair activities (for single-family and multi-family units respectively) and about 11
types of capital improvements that may have been made to their properties. It is likely that 12 of these
6 According to the Painting and Decorating Council, exteriors of homes are usually painted every 4-12 years; thus, the analysis
uses the midpoint, eight, for estimating the number of Exterior Painting events.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-11
maintenance, repair, or upgrade activities require disturbing painted surfaces; these activities are listed in
Table 4-3 according to the event category that they are classified by in this analysis.
The percentage of units where at least one of the RRP activities listed under each event was performed is
calculated separately for single- and multi-family units. This is because the average square footage of
these two groups of housing differs, and the estimated costs for many of the work practices required by
the rule depend on the size of the work area. Similar to the owner-occupied event estimates, when
multiple tasks are reported in POMS, this analysis assumes that these tasks are performed together in the
same area. Therefore, the compliance costs are estimated based on those costs associated with the task
with the largest work area. Unlike in the AHS data, POMS respondents were not asked whether sanding
or scraping was performed before painting (and painting without sanding or scraping is not subject to the
rule’s requirements). Therefore, it is assumed that 40 percent of the households reporting interior
painting are subject to the rule’s requirements based on the percentage of rental households that reported
sanding or scraping before painting in the AHS.7
In POMS, questions about capital improvements were asked about the entire property rather than about a
specific unit. To account for this difference, it was assumed that a specific unit was worked on 40% of
the time an upgrade was reported for a property. Since properties average about three units each, this
assumption results in more renovation compared to the assumption that upgrades are performed on one
unit at a time. The assumption utilized in this analysis results in renovation frequencies in multi-family
properties that are similar to those estimated for single-family properties.
Window or door replacement tasks are assigned to their own event category, because (as described in
Section 4.2.1.5 there is a higher likelihood that windows and doors contain LBP, and this analysis
accounts for the likelihood of LBP by component type. Since POMS does not ask respondents about
replacing windows or doors, the frequency for these tasks is assumed to be the same in rental units as was
reported in AHS for owner-occupied units. Therefore, it is assumed that 3.7 and 3.4 percent of renter-
occupied single- and multi-family units, respectively, replace windows or doors each year. Since these
improvements are likely to be reported in the POMS data as “other major upgrades,” this analysis adjusts
downward the numbers of “other major upgrade” tasks that are reported in POMS to reflect this. Since 10
and 14.8 percent of owner-occupied single- and multi-family units, respectively, reported other major
upgrades, 37 and 23 percent of “other major upgrades” reported in the POMS are assumed to be window
or door replacements, for single- and multi-family units respectively.8
Similar to the methodology for the owner-occupied RRP event estimates, it is assumed that HVAC
related activities do not always incur compliance costs. The analysis assumes that compliance costs are
incurred 28 percent and 15 percent of the time for single- and multi-family units respectively, which is the
percentage of the time new equipment is installed when HVAC work is performed in owner-occupied
units according to the 1997 AHS.
7 The 40 percent of rental units that reported sanding or scraping before painting in AHS compares to the 35 percent
of owner-occupied units that reported sanding or scraping before painting in AHS.
8 37% = 3.7%/10% and 23% = 3.4%/14.8%.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-12
4.2.1.4 Extrapolating from the POMS and AHS Data
After calculating the percentages of rental units where RRP was performed in the event categories listed
in Table 4-3, the number of renter-occupied events in these categories are calculated by applying the
event frequencies calculated with the 1995 POMS data to the number of rental-units according to the
2003 AHS. It is assumed that Whole Exterior events and Contained Exterior events occur in rental units
with the same frequency as they do in owner-occupied units (since data on these types of events are not
available in the POMS). Additional tasks reported in the AHS data but not the POMS data are not
estimated for rental units since these renovation activities are fairly uncommon in rental units and likely
to already be reported as “other major upgrade” and counted as a wall-disturbing event.
Estimating the Number of Target Housing Events Affected by the Removal of the Opt-out
Provision
The LRRP revisions remove the opt-out provision from the LRRP rule for certain owner-occupied
housing units. Owner-occupied target housing units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant
woman resides, rental units, and COFs (including owner-occupied target housing units that qualify as
COFs) would not be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision because these units were not
eligible for this provision under the 2008 LRRP rule.
The number of housing units that would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision is
estimated by taking the number of owner-occupied housing units and subtracting the number of owner-
occupied target housing units that: (1) have a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in residence,
or (2) are COFs.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-13
Owner-occupied housing units with a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in residence
The 2003 AHS data identifies owner-occupied housing units where a child under the age of six or a
pregnant woman resides. AHS respondents report information about the ages of householders, who are
defined by the survey as persons who live or sleep there most of the time. Thus, child-occupied
households are defined as those households with a householder under the age of 6 at the time of the RRP.
Child-occupied households are estimated as households with a householder between the ages of one and
seven at the time of the survey since it is assumed that any RRP reported occurred a year earlier (RRP
performed up to two years earlier may be reported). It follows that a household is defined as being
occupied by a pregnant woman if there is a woman of childbearing age and a child who is under the age
of one in the household at the time of the survey.
Owner-Occupied housing units that are COFs
COFs in target housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and neighbors
who regularly care for someone else’s children. The estimated number of target housing COFs includes
care provided with and without compensation and relies primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare
workforce (Center for the Child Care Workforce 2002). The Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002)
report includes: (1) data on family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes,
(2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing child care, and (3) unpaid relatives and non-relatives
providing child care.
The number of target housing COFs is projected based on estimates of the caregiver workforce in the
Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002) report. Based on a Wilder Research Center report, it is
assumed that 10 percent of family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes
employ 2 workers (Wilder Research Center 2001, p.16). For the remaining childcare providers, one
worker is assumed per location. Based on 2003 American Housing Survey data for the general
population of housing, it is assumed that 65 percent of these housing units were built before 1978.
The number of target housing units where child care is provised was also adjusted to exclude those units
that are already included in the RRP rule universe because care is provided in a child’s own home, or
where the units do not qualify as COFs because less than six hours of care per-week is provided9. In
addition, the number of target housing COFs that are not eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008
LRRP rule because they are rental units or have a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in
residence must be estimated to avoid double counting. The basis for these adjustments is discussed
below.
Care Provided in Child’s Own Home
It is assumed that 22 percent of relatives and non-relatives (paid or unpaid) providing care provide it in
the child’s home based on a Wilder Research Center (2005, p.28) report on the results of the 2004
Minnesota Statewide Household Child Care Survey.
Less Than Six Hours of Care Per-Week is Provided
Of those providing care in their own home, it is assumed that 27 percent of relatives and non-relatives
(paid or unpaid) provide care for less than six hours a week (Wilder Research Center 2005, p.28). All
family daycare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes are assumed to care for at least
one child for more than six hours a week.
9 There is not sufficient data to adjust for the other COF criteria that the building is visited at least 2 different days within any
week, that each day’s visits lasts at least 3 hours, or that the combined annual visits last at least 60 hours.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-14
Caregiver Lives in a Rental Unit
It is assumed that family, friend, and neighbor caregivers have the same likelihood of living in a rental
unit as the general population of target housing occupants (39 percent).
Caregiver has a Child Under Six Living With Them
Based on the January 2006 Current Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2006), 16 percent
of Child Care Workers have children under six. Thus, it is assumed that 16 percent of in-home family
daycare providers (formal care providers) caring for unrelated children in their own homes have children
under the age of six. Based on the Wilder Research Center (2005, p.19) report, 57.5 percent of family,
friend, and neighbor caregivers (informal care providers) have children under the age of 12. Thus it is
assumed that half as many, or 29 percent, have children under the age of six.

rule.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-15
Target Housing Units Affected by the Removal of the Opt-out Provision
As described in Table 4-4, there are about 824,000 target housing COFs where no child under the age of
six or a pregnant woman resides. Thus, of the 47,080,000 owner occupied housing units (see Section 2.8
of Chapter 2):
 A child under six resides or pregnant woman resides in 6,370,000 units (see Section 2.8 of
Chapter 2)
 About 824,000 units are COFs where no child under the age of six or pregnant woman resides
(see Table 4-4)
Therefore, about 39,886,000 units would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision.10 The
frequency of RRP events in these housing units is estimated using the 2003 AHS data as described in
section 4.2.1.2.
4.2.1.5 Likelihood of Positive Test Kit Result for LBP
It is assumed that all certified renovators use a test kit for LBP before performing any RRP, given that
performing this relatively inexpensive test may allow the renovator to avoid the costs of using Lead-Safe
Work Practices (LSWP) that are required when LBP is disturbed. Since LBP is most likely to be found
on certain components of housing units—and therefore most likely to be disturbed during certain types of
renovations—the analysis accounts for this by estimating LBP likelihoods specific to each event type.
These LBP likelihoods are estimated using data from HUD’s 2000 National Survey of Lead and
Allergens in Housing (HUD 2001).11 The survey has information on approximately 630 housing units
built before 1978 including data on the presence of LBP in certain rooms (e.g. kitchen) and on certain
components or surfaces (e.g. floors, walls, ceilings, doors and windows).
The probability that LBP is disturbed during a RRP event is estimated as the probability of LBP in any of
the rooms where RRP is performed or on any of the components that might be disturbed during the RRP
event. This assumption leads to an upward bias in the estimates of the number of events where LSWP are
required. For example, if there is LBP in the kitchen, it is assumed that a kitchen remodeling will disturb
LBP. However, the LBP component(s) will not necessarily always be disturbed. For example, the LBP
in the kitchen may be on the window trim, but the renovation may not disturb the window trim.
Unfortunately, there is no reasonable basis for correcting this bias using currently available data. For the
purposes of this analysis, data from HUD (2001) are used to estimate event-specific likelihoods of
positive test kit results based on the estimated likelihood of disturbing LBP for each event type, as
described in Table 4-5.
10 39,886,000 = 47,080,000 – 6,370,000 – 824,000.
11 In addition to the likelihood of the presence of lead-based paint varying by age of housing, there is evidence that
the concentration of lead in the paint varies by the age of housing. A review of the data in HUD 2000 is
presented in EPA 2005c. This document is available in the docket for this rulemaking.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-16
Test kits for LBP that are currently available have false positive rates that range from 47 percent to 78
percent. This analysis assumes a false positive rate of 63 percent, the midpoint, for the first year following
rule implementation. This analysis assumes that an improved test kit that will have a false positive rate of
10 percent or less will be in use by June 2011.12 A false negative rate of 5 percent is also assumed for
both the current and improved test kits. Thus, the likelihood of a positive test kit result in the first year is
estimated as 95 percent of the likelihood of LBP, plus 63 percent of the percentage of homes without
LBP. In the second year, the likelihood of a positive test kit result is estimated as 95 percent of the
likelihood of LBP plus 10 percent of the percentage of homes without LBP. Table 4-6 shows the
likelihoods of LBP that are used to estimate the percentage of events where LBP is disturbed.
In cases where a household performed more than one interior event, the likelihood of disturbing LBP is
estimated as the likelihood of LBP anywhere in the interior of the unit. There are two exceptions to this:
(1) when one of the events is an Addition, the Addition likelihood is used, and (2) when the sum of the
12 EPA believes that the sensitivity of test kits can be adjusted so the results reliably correspond to one of the two
Federal standards for lead-based paint (1.0 mg/cm2 and 0.5% by weight). EPA is working on the development
of test kits that accurately identify both the presence and absence of lead in paint at levels that exceed the
Federal standards. EPA is confident that improved test kits can be commercially available by September 2010,
although for ease of computation, this analysis does not assume they will be in use until June 2011.

Event Type

require some demolition of the interior and exterior)

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-17
individual event probabilities is less than the likelihood of LBP anywhere in the interior of the unit, the
sum of the event probabilities is used. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because the data are
not sufficient for calculating the joint probabilities that would be necessary for relaxing this assumption.
As a result, the estimates of the number of events where LSWP will be used are biased upward. That is,
for a housing unit performing multiple interior events, it is assumed that if there is LBP in the housing
unit, all the interior events in that unit require LSWP. However, the LBP component(s) may be disturbed
only in certain areas throughout the house, requiring less containment than is assumed. Similar to the
assumptions pertaining to households performing multiple interior events, for households performing
multiple exterior events the likelihood of disturbing LBP is assumed to be the maximum likelihood for
the events performed. Unlike for interior events, this is always the same as the largest and most costly
exterior event that determines the housing unit’s exterior compliance costs.
4.2.1.6 Event Sizes
For interior events, the average square footage of particular rooms was determined by taking the average
square footage of the whole unit from the AHS and reviewing house plans for homes of similar square
footage (Homestyles.com 2002). The work area sizes for wall-disturbing events were estimated as
follows:

single-family owner occupied home. The perimeter of a single-family renter unit was estimated to be 130
feet, which assumes that the proportion of a single-family renter unit has the same proportion of total square
footage to square footage of the first floor of a single-family owner unit. The perimeter of a multi-family

The structures in a Contained Exterior event are outside the main body of the house and the structural work

estimated to be 60 feet (10’×20’). Containment is necessary along the entire perimeter of a detached
structure. However, it is assumed that less containment is required for attached contained exterior structures,
which are assumed to be attached to the main structure of the house along a 20 foot side of the detached
contained exterior structure. The analysis assumes half are attached structures and half are detached
structures.
a Estimated based on information from http://www.dreamhomesource.com (2005) on the average size of the first floor of nine
2,000 square foot two stories homes (1,280 sq. feet). The weighted average of a first floor was calculated using 2003 AHS data
which shows that 85% of single-family housing units are two stories high and the remaining 15% of homes are one story (i.e.,
first floor is 2,016 sq. feet).
4.2.1.7 Estimated Number of RRP Events in the First and Second Years
The numbers of regulated events are estimated using the methodology outlined above along with the
assumption that 75 percent of the RRP events subject to the rule’s requirements comply with the
requirements. This assumption is based on compliance rates observed for the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration’s (OSHA) regulations for the construction industry (Gilkeya 2003 and Weil 1999).
The variation in the number of regulated events in compliance under the different options reflects the
variation in the regulated universe.
Table 4-13 through Table 4-16 present the numbers of RRP events potentially affected by the removal of
the opt-out provision by type of event, for the first and second year the rule is in effect. Note that Option
C does not go into effect until the second year, so this option does not affect any events in the first year.
Each table shows the total number of events where compliance costs are incurred, labeled “All Events.”
“All Events” include all the events where a test kit was used to test for LBP. The columns labeled “LBP
Events” include all the events where test kits correctly identified that LBP was present; it does not include
events where there was a false positive or a false negative test kit result. The columns labeled “LSWP
Events” include all events where there was a positive test kit result – including false positives. The
LSWP event estimate is the estimated number of events where compliance costs associated with cleaning,
containment, and verification are incurred. Table 4-17 through Table 4-19 present the likelihoods of
events where LBP is correctly identified as well as those where there was a positive test kit result (LSWP
Events).

Notes: Events where compliance costs are incurred include those that are: (1) subject to the rule’s
requirements, and (2) in compliance. Thus, this includes some events where LSWP are not required because
a test kit indicates that LBP is not present. It excludes the 25% of regulated events that are assumed to be
noncompliant. A “-” indicates that zero events were estimated; a “0” indicates that fewer than 500 events
were estimated. All Events With Costs include those where there is a negative test kit result for LBP. LBP
Events include all the events where test kits correctly identified that LBP was present; it does not include
events where there was a false positive or a false negative test kit result. LSWP events include all events with
test kit results that are positive for LBP, including false positive results. See Table 4-1 for options
descriptions. Note that the number of LSWP events is equal to the number of LBP events (which exclude
false negatives) plus the number of false positive events; i.e., (LSWP Events) = (LBP Events) + ((All Events
With Costs) – (LBP Events)/0.95) * (False Positive Rate).

4.2.2 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting Events in
COFs in Public or Commercial Buildings
This section describes the proposed methodology for estimating the number of events in daycare centers,
pre-schools and kindergartens—i.e., COFs in public or commercial buildings. Events in these structures
are all regulated under the existing LRRP program. Events in these structures, however, will be affected
by the proposed revision to require the provision of the recordkeeping checklist to owners or occupants.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-29
4.2.2.1 Data Sources
This section provides a brief summary of the primary data sources used to estimate the number of RRP
events in COFs in public or commercial buildings.
HUD's (2003) First National Health Survey of Child Care Centers
HUD’s (2003) First National Environmental Health Survey of Child Care Centers was conducted under
the sponsorship of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to assess children's
potential exposure to lead, allergens, and pesticides in licensed child care centers. The survey data were
collected in 2001 and were published in 2003; they include data on 98 childcare centers that are known to
have been built before 1978. Note that while the data only includes child care centers, some of these
centers are located in schools and the information on lead likelihoods, characteristics of classrooms, and
the frequencies of painting are extrapolated to elementary schools with pre-schools or kindergartens. This
survey can be used to estimate lead levels in dust, paint, and soil in childcare centers. This analysis uses
these data to estimate: (1) likelihoods of LBP on various components that might be disturbed during RRP,
(2) various characteristics of the rooms and buildings (such as the size and number of rooms, windows,
and doors), and (3) the frequency of interior painting, exterior painting, and cleaning.
Whitestone (2006) Building Maintenance and Repair Cost Reference 2006-2007
Whitestone Research is a commercial service that provides data on the frequency of different types of
maintenance activities and their costs, for use by building managers and investors. For over 50 building
types (including both elementary schools and childcare centers), Whitestone defines a typical building
and lists the building components they are likely to contain (e.g. type of windows, type of interior and
exterior wall coverings, type of heating system, etc.). Whitestone lists the frequency and type of repairs
each building component will need, including replacements. The Whitestone data can be used to estimate
the types and frequency of RRP work for COFs in public or commercial buildings.
4.2.2.2 Description of Methodology for Estimating the Number of RRP Events in COFs in Public or
Commercial Buildings
The basic steps for estimating the number of events are:
1. Estimate the number of COFs (rooms and buildings),
2. Estimate the frequency of performing an event,
3. Estimate the likelihood that an event will be covered by the rule (disturbing paint).
4. Combine the results of the above four steps to estimate: (1) annual number of buildings and
classrooms where more than six square feet of a painted surface per room is disturbed for interior
renovations, or twenty square feet for exterior renovations.
The methodology for performing these steps is described below in more detail.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-30
Step 1: Estimate the Number of Public or Commercial Building COFs (rooms and centers)
Based on the number of daycare centers reported to be located in schools according to the HUD (2003)
data, 22 percent of the estimated 115,000 centers are estimated to be located in elementary schools. Thus,
these 25,300 daycare centers are assumed to be accounted for in the estimated 40,190 elementary schools
with pre-schools and kindergartens. Although an additional 1,421 pre-schools are located in schools
without kindergarten programs (such as middle or high schools), these pre-schools are included in the
count of daycare centers for the purposes of the total cost analysis. In summary, there are 40,190
elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, 37,049 elementary schools with kindergartens but
no pre-school and 89,261 daycare centers (see Section 2.9 of Chapter 2).13 Using data from the
Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) for education buildings (DOE 2003), it
was estimated that 58 percent of buildings were built prior to 1978. The HUD (2003) data was used to
estimate the relative number of pre-1960 buildings.
This analysis considers three categories of COFs in public or commercial buildings: (1) daycare centers,
(2) elementary schools with kindergartens only, and (3) elementary schools with kindergartens and pre-
schools. The analysis distinguishes between these types of buildings because they have different sizes
and thus different compliance costs. The number of childcare center classrooms was estimated using the
HUD (2003) data. The estimated numbers of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms per building
are 3.8 and 6.7 for elementary schools with kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and
kindergartens, respectively. The number of pre-school classrooms per building was estimated based on
the number of pre-kindergarten schools and classes reported in the NCES Prekindergarten in U.S. Public
Schools 2000-2001 Report (U.S. Department of Education 2003). The number of kindergarten
classrooms per building was estimated based on the number of kindergarten schools and classes reported
in the Full-Day and Half-Day Kindergarten in the United States 1998-1999 (U.S. Department of
Education 2003). In addition, this analysis accounts for RRP events in spaces other than classrooms in the
public or commercial buildings that might be visited by children under the age of six on a regular basis
(libraries, cafeterias, gyms, etc.).
Spaces in Addition To Regular Kindergarten and Pre-Kindergarten Classrooms Regularly Visited
by Children Under Age Six
At least for part of the year, children under the age of 6 are in first grade. In addition, in some schools
children under the age of 6 might use other rooms on a regular basis, including libraries, cafeterias, gyms,
computer rooms, and music and/or art rooms.
According to NCES’s 2005 After-School Programs and Activities Survey of the National Household
Education Surveys Program data, just under 0.5 percent of all first graders are 5 years old. Thus there are
nearly 19,000 first graders who are age 5 (NCES 2005). The survey collected age data as of December
31st of 2004 and as such does not include children who turned 6 after the start of the school year in
September but before the end of December. Thus it is thus likely that this figure underestimates the
number of children who are 5 years old when they enter first grade. While the total number of five year
olds in first grade is relatively small, any class with one of these children is subject to the rule.
Unlike for pre-kindergartens or kindergartens, there is no data on the number of first grade classrooms in
the United States. The number of first grade classrooms was estimated based on student enrollment and
the average number of first graders in a typical classroom. Data on the average number of students in first
grade were obtained from four states – Texas, New Hampshire, New York, and Illinois (Texas Education
13 The 89,261 daycare centers include 1,421 schools with pre-kindergarten but no kindergarten, and 87,840 daycare
centers located outside of schools (see Section 2.9 of Chapter 2).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-31
Agency 1999; New Hampshire Department of Education 2006; New York State Office of the State
Comptroller 2005; ASU 2007). The number of students per classroom reported in these states ranged
from 18 to 21.6, with an average of 20 students per classroom. To estimate the total number of first grade
classrooms, the total number of first graders (3,663,005 in public schools + 439,510 in private schools)
was divided by the average of 20 students per first-grade class. The resulting number of classrooms
(205,126) was divided by the total number of schools with a first grade (51,572 public schools + 22,362
private schools) to estimate the average number of classrooms per school.14 Based on these calculations,
there is an average of 2.8 first grade classrooms per school.
Data were not available on the amount of the school day or week that kindergartners and first graders
spend outside of their primary classroom or the rooms they visit. Nor were data available on the average
size of these rooms in older elementary schools. Thus the following assumptions were made:
Gyms are about the size of 5 classrooms. This estimate is based on the assumption that most elementary
school gyms will accommodate a basketball court. A basketball court is 3,108 square feet and an average
classroom is 729 square feet (ProDunkHoops 2006; HUD 2003). Thus, a basketball court is about 4.25
classrooms, which was rounded up to 5 to accommodate bleachers, etc.
 Cafeterias are about the same size as an elementary school gym.
 Elementary school libraries are about the size of 2 classrooms
 Students were also assumed to regularly spend time in at least one other classroom (e.g. computer
room, music or art room).
Estimates were generated using data on the percentage of public elementary schools that have various
non-classroom facilities as follows:
 Cafeteria 98%15 (NCES 2006g)
 Library 95% (NCES 2004)
 Gymnasium 80% (NCES 2007)
Using these percentages and the classroom-equivalent sizes for rooms specified above, the equivalent of
an additional 12 rooms was assumed to be covered by the rule because children under the age of 6 use
them in addition to their regular classrooms. The calculation is:
98% * (1 cafeteria)*(5 classroom equivalents) + 95% * (1 library)*(2 classroom equivalents) +
80% * (1 gym)*(5 classroom equivalents) + (1 extra room) = 12 classroom equivalents.
14 The numbers of first graders in public and private schools were drawn from NCES’s Overview of Public
Elementary and Secondary Students, Staff, Schools, School Districts, Revenues, and Expenditures: School Year
2004-2005 and Fiscal Year 2004 (NCES 2006a) and Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States:
Results From the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey (NCES 2006e), respectively. The numbers of
public and private schools with first grades were calculated using NCES’s Common Core of Data Public
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey Data, 2004-2005 (NCES 2006b) and 2003-2004 Private School
Universe Survey Data (NCES 2006f), respectively.
15 This figure is based on the number of schools providing food services in a cafeteria or lunch room. Since many
elementary schools use the gymnasium as a lunch room, there may be substantial overlap between cafeterias
and gymnasiums. Also, in some schools children do not eat in the cafeteria until 1st grade. Thus, this may
overestimate the areas in schools potentially impacted by the rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-32
In addition, an average of 2.8 first grade classrooms are assumed to be covered by the rule, making the
average total number of additional classroom equivalents 14.8. The estimated numbers of pre-
kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms per building are 3.8 and 6.7 for elementary schools with
kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, respectively. Thus, the average
numbers of classrooms and classroom equivalents covered under the rule are 18.6 and 21.5 for elementary
schools with kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, respectively.
The resulting estimates of the number of regulated daycare centers and elementary schools with
preschools or kindergartens, as well as the number of regulated classrooms in these buildings are
presented in Table 4-20.
Step 2: Estimate the frequency of performing an event
Interior Painting
When asked how often they repainted the interior, respondents to the HUD (2003) survey could respond:
(1) every 1 to 4 years, (2) every 5 to 10 years, or (3) every 10 to 20 years. The average frequency of
painting was estimated using the midpoints for these ranges (weighted averages were calculated using the
buildings’ survey weight). On average, building interiors are painted every 4.4 years. It is assumed that
35 percent involve sanding and/or scraping before painting, based on data for housing units (EPA 2006).
Exterior Painting
When asked how often they repainted the exterior, respondents to the HUD (2003) survey could respond:
(1) every 1 to 4 years, (2) every 5 to 10 years, or (3) every 10 to 20 years. The average frequency of
painting was estimated using the midpoints for these ranges (weighted averages were calculated using the
building’s survey weight); on average, buildings paint their exterior every 7 years. Thus, the analysis
assumes that buildings with exterior paint (about 90 percent of the buildings have exterior paint) are
painted every seven years. It is assumed that the exterior is always sanded or scraped before painting
(EPA 2006).
Wall Disturbing Events
The number of events where walls are disturbed is considered separately from those events that generally
disturb trim, doors, and windows, which have higher likelihoods of LBP. The number of wall disturbing
events is estimated using the Whitestone Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Cost Reference. The
Whitestone M&R Cost Reference provides information on the frequency of a wide variety of maintenance
and repair activities. As described in their Preface, the book is intended for two audiences.
“The first group has a common need to know the long-term M&R costs of specific
buildings. This group consists of analysts, developers, architects, bankers, investors and

*The stock of public or commercial buildings is assumed to decline by 0.41% per year. That rate was
calculated using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock using data from
the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Census Bureau 1990 and 2000c).

others who must account for M&R costs that, over a 50-year building lifetime, can easily
exceed the cost of construction. … The second audience consists of facility managers and
all those responsible for estimating and justifying facility maintenance budgets.”
The bulk of the reference is composed of detailed lists of building components and M&R tasks, along
with their average size, frequency of the M&R tasks, trade involved (e.g. plumber, carpenter) and
estimated cost. The reference also provides building profiles for 56 different building types, including
childcare centers and elementary schools. Each profile lists the typical building components for that
building type and then generates a 50-year stream of expenditures that cover these building components.
The number of wall disturbing events is estimated based on the following categories of RRP events:
 Replace Plumbing Pipes and Fixtures
 Replace HVAC Systems
 Replace Electrical System and Fixtures
Using the frequencies of major renewal and replacement tasks that are likely to disturb lead-based paint
for the building components described in the childcare center and elementary school profiles, this analysis
developed the assumed frequency of RRP events shown in Table 4-21.

Source: Derived from Whitestone M&R Reference (2006).
Because historical data on M&R activities for wall disturbing events in these buildings are not available,
and to simplify the calculations, it is assumed that the RRP events are evenly spread over the population
of buildings. In other words, if a plumbing replacement job typically occurs once every 10 years, the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-35
analysis assumes that one-tenth of the buildings experience this RRP event in any given year. Thus in
any given year, it is assumed that plumbing is replaced in 10 percent of buildings, HVAC systems are
replaced in 10 percent of buildings and electrical systems are replaced in 5 percent of buildings. If
multiple jobs are occurring in the same building, the analysis assumes they occur at different times in the
year and thus each incurs its own work practice costs. To the extent that these events are actually
occurring at the same time, the analysis overestimates the work practice costs. The Whitestone data does
not include information on the frequency of unscheduled maintenance events. Instead, this analysis
assumes that 1 out of 11 classrooms have an unscheduled maintenance job performed in a given year –
this is approximately one job per building. The number of unscheduled maintenance events is based on
an assumption, and not on empirical data.
Window and Door Replacement Events
The number of events where windows and doors are disturbed is also estimated using the Whitestone
M&R Cost Reference, which listed the frequency with which door and window types typically found in
elementary schools and daycare centers must be replaced—about every 20 years. Thus, in any given
year, windows and doors are assumed to be replaced in 5 percent of buildings.
Step 3: Estimate the likelihood that an event will be affected by the rule (disturbing paint)
The next step is to estimate how many events in public or commercial building COFs disturb painted
surfaces and therefore would be affected by the recordkeeping checklist provision requirement of the
LRRP rule revision. This analysis considers four types of events for public or commercial buildings: (1)
Interior Painting, (2) Exterior Painting, (3) Window Replacement, and (4) Wall Disturbing Events (e.g.,
plumbing, electrical). It is estimated that 35 percent of interior painting jobs involve disturbing painted
surfaces (i.e., sanding and/or scraping before painting), based on data for housing units (EPA 2006). All
other event types are always assumed to disturb painted surfaces.
Step 4: Combine the results
The number of affected classrooms or buildings is multiplied by the frequency of renovation activities
that disturb painted surfaces to yield the number of events in public or commercial buildings where the
recordkeeping checklist will have to be provided by the renovator. These results are presented in Table 4-
22.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-36
4.3 Work Practice Compliance Costs
RRP projects generate varying amounts of leaded dust, paint chips, and other lead-contaminated materials
depending on the type of work, size of area affected, and work methods used. For example, repairing a
small area of damaged drywall is likely to generate less lead-contaminated dust and debris than sanding a
large area in preparation for painting. Because of this variability, the size of the area that must be isolated
and the containment methods used will vary from project to project. Large renovation projects could
involve one or more rooms and potentially encompass an entire home or building while small projects
may involve a portion of a room or a building’s exterior. The necessary work area preparations will
depend on the size of the surface(s) being disturbed, the method used in disturbing the surface, and the
building layout. The certified renovator assigned to a renovation would weigh all of these factors in
determining the appropriate work area size for that particular situation. For example, repairing a small
area of damaged drywall would probably require a smaller work area while demolition work would
probably require a larger work area in order to prevent the migration of dust and debris from the work
area.
Note that the costs of the proposed action as estimated in the Economic Analysis are expressed in 2005
dollars. To express values in terms of current dollars, the Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic
Product as determined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis can be consulted for an indication of how
nominal prices for goods and services produced in the economy have changed over time. From 2005 to
the second quarter of 2009, the implicit price deflator increased from 100 to 109.686, a difference of
approximately 10 percent (BEA 2009).
4.3.1 LBP Test Kit Compliance Costs
It is assumed that spot test kits are used to test for LBP before each RRP event where a lead inspection
has not been performed; they are inexpensive to use and a negative result will allow the renovator to forgo
the more costly containment, cleaning and verification requirements. Lead test kits currently can be

was calculated using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-37
purchased in bulk at a cost of approximately $0.50 per test. It is assumed that the renovator will take an
average of four samples, because some jobs may disturb multiple components (walls, trim, windows, etc.)
or multiple rooms, and testing four samples will require about 15 minutes of a certified renovator’s time.
The loaded wage rate for certified renovators is $31.64/hour16. Thus, testing using the test kits is
estimated to cost $10 per event (15 minutes * $31.64/hour + 4 test kits * $0.50/test = $10).
RRP purchasers may choose to have x-ray fluorescence (XRF) testing conducted to detect the presence of
LBP instead of using a test kit. XRF testing has the advantage of having lower false positive rates but the
testing cost per event is much higher than a test kit. Therefore, it is assumed that test kits are used in lieu
of XRF testing.
4.3.2 Containment, Cleaning, and Verification
The containment and cleaning practices covered in the cost estimates are:17
For large interior events:
 Remove or cover all objects in the room where the renovation will be performed including
furniture, rugs, and window coverings.
 Close and cover all ducts opening into the room with taped-down plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material.
 Close windows and doors in the work area. Doors must be covered with plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material. Doors used as an entrance to the work area must be covered with plastic
sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to pass through while
confining dust and debris to the work area.18
 Cover the floor with taped-down plastic sheeting or other impermeable material. Place a tack pad
at the edge of the sheeting at the entrance to the room. Cover paths through the rest of the
buildings used by persons performing the renovation with plastic sheeting or other impermeable
material.
For small interior events:
 Remove or cover all objects within five feet of the work area, including furniture, rugs, and
window coverings.
 Close all windows, doors, and ducts within five feet of the work area. Cover ducts with plastic
sheeting or other impermeable material.
 Cover the floor within five feet of the work area with taped-down plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material.
 Wear disposable shoe covers and vacuum clothes.
16 Wages are based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005a) data, from the occupational employment statistics series. All
wages are fully loaded to account for fringe benefits with an average fringe rate for the construction industry of 23.5 percent.
Certified renovators’ fully loaded wages ($31.64/hour) are estimated from the wages earned by First-Line
Supervisors/Managers of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers (Occupation 47-1011) who work in the residential
building construction industry. Workers’ loaded wages ($16.94/hour) are estimated from the wages of Construction
Laborers who work in the residential building construction industry (Occupation 47-2061).
17 For the purposes of simplifying the modeling of the costs, some of the work practices described here are slightly
different than those practices required by the rule. The costs of these practices are expected to be representative
of the practices required by the rule.
18 This analysis assumes that contractors will meet the entrance door requirement by creating an airlock using two
sheets of plastic.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-38
For large and small exterior events:
 Cover the ground with plastic sheeting or other disposable impermeable material extending out
from the edge of the structure a sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris.
 Ensure that doors within the work area that must be used while the job is being performed are
covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to
pass through while confining dust and debris to the work area.
For all events:
 Post signs warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to remain
outside of the work area.
 Isolate the work area so that no visible dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is
being performed.
 Contain waste from renovation activities to prevent releases of dust and debris before the waste is
removed from the work area for storage or disposal.
 At the conclusion of each workday, store waste from renovation activities under containment, in
an enclosure, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris and prevents access to
dust and debris.
 Pick up all paint chips and debris.
 Remove plastic sheeting from objects in the work area and the floor or ground. Mist the sheeting
before folding it, fold the dirty side inward and tape shut to seal. Dispose of the sheeting as
waste.
Additional Cleaning for interior events
 Clean all objects and surfaces in and around the work area for interior events in the following
manner, cleaning from higher to lower:
a. Thoroughly vacuum all surfaces and objects in the work area, including furniture and
fixtures, with a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.
Where feasible, floor surfaces underneath a rug or carpeting must also be thoroughly
vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum.
b. Wipe all surfaces and objects in the work area with a damp cloth (except for walls,
ceilings, carpeted surfaces and upholstered surfaces).
c. Mop uncarpeted floors thoroughly, using a two-bucket mopping method that keeps
the wash water separate from the rinse water, or using a wet mopping system.
Post-renovation cleaning verification for interior events:
 A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine if visible amounts of dust,
debris or residue are still present. If visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are present, these
conditions must be eliminated by re-cleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
 After a successful visual inspection, a certified renovator must:
a. Wipe uncarpeted floors within the work area with a disposable wet cleaning cloth.
The cloth must remain damp at all times while it is being used to wipe the floor for
post-cleaning verification. If the floor surface within the work area is greater than 40
square feet, the floor within the area must be divided into roughly equal sections that
are less than 40 square feet. Wipe each such section separately with a new
disposable cleaning cloth. If the cloths used to wipe each section of the floor within
the work area match the cleaning verification card, that section of the floor has been
adequately cleaned.
b. If the cloth used to wipe a particular section of floor does not match the cleaning
verification card, re-clean that section of the floor using the two-bucket mopping
method. Then wipe that section of the floor using a new wet cleaning cloth. If the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-39
cloth matches the cleaning verification card, that section of the floor has been
adequately cleaned.
c. If the second cloth used to wipe a particular floor section does not match the cleaning
verification card, re-clean that section of the floor using the two-bucket mopping
method described above and allow the entire floor within the work area to dry
completely. After the entire floor within the work area has completely dried, wipe
the floor with electrostatic cleaning cloths until a cloth that has wiped the entire floor
matches the cleaning verification card.19
d. Wipe the windowsills in the work area following the same protocol as used for floors
but with one wet-wipe per-windowsill.
e. When the area passes the post-renovation cleaning verification, remove the warning
signs.
Post-renovation cleaning verification for exterior events:
 A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine if visible amounts of dust,
debris or residue are still present. If visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are present, these
conditions must be eliminated by re-cleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
When the area passes the visual inspection, remove the warning signs.
4.3.3 Cost of Each Containment and Cleaning Practice
The primary source of information on the cost of containment and cleaning practices, equipment, and
materials was the Means CostWorks Repair & Remodeling Cost Data (R.S. Means 2005). The data are
designed to help contractors estimate the cost of a renovation project. The database provides the total
labor and material costs of different renovation components on a unit basis. Most of the unit costs taken
from the R.S. Means database utilized in this analysis were for an asbestos abatement project, which
requires much more elaborate containment and clean up than required under the analyzed options. The
R.S. Means labor estimates have been adjusted downwards to reflect the less stringent requirements of the
LRRP rule. Depending on the type of activity, the unit may be a square foot, each item, or some other
measure. Table 4-23 and Table 4-24 show the material costs, labor requirements and total cost for the
containment and cleaning practices for interior events and exterior events, respectively.
19 It is assumed that a second cleaning is required 30 percent of the time and a third cleaning is required 2 percent of
the time.

Table 4-25 and Table 4-26 describe how the number of units required for each work practice is estimated
for the various event types. This methodology is the same as that used to estimate work practice costs in
the 2008 LRRP rule analysis (EPA 2008). Appendix 4A in the Economic Analysis of the 2008 LRRP
rule (EPA 2008) presents the resulting estimates for each type of event. The number of units is multiplied
by the per-unit costs, which can be per-each, per-square foot, or per hour, as described above in section
4.3.3.

4.3.5 Baseline Frequency of Prohibited Practice and Costs of Alternatives
Several paint preparation and removal practices are prohibited or restricted in renovations that require
lead-safe work practices under the existing rule. A telephone questionnaire was administered to nine
respondents to gather information on the baseline use of certain paint removal practices. The respondents
included six painting firms and three historic home restoration firms. The six painting firms were
randomly drawn from the online sales lead provider, Salesgenie.com. The historic home restoration firms
were drawn randomly from the Old House Journal’s online restoration directory.
These firms were asked how often they used the following four paint removal techniques on the interior
and exterior of pre-1978 buildings:
1. Open flame burning or torching of paint;
2. Using a heat gun above 1,100º F;
3. Power sanding, grinding, or abrasive blasting except when done with HEPA exhaust control; and
4. Dry scraping of lead based-paint.
If the firms reported that they did not use the method, they were asked why they did not use it and what
alternatives they used instead. They were also asked how much they thought costs would increase if the
specific removal technique was prohibited and if there were any situations where use of the method could
not be avoided. When responding firms could not precisely state what percentage of the time they used a
certain work practice they were prompted with never, rarely, sometimes, often or nearly always. These
prompted answers are assumed to correspond with the following percentages:

Based on these estimates it was estimated that interior and exterior painting jobs use various paint
removal techniques with the frequencies presented in Table 4-29. Since several respondents indicated
that they typically used heat guns at lower temperatures that are allowed under the LRRP rule (under
1100 °F), it was assumed that 20 percent of paint removal was performed with low temperature heat guns.
The remaining 80 percent of paint removal practices were assumed to occur proportionally to the
frequencies in the telephone questionnaire responses so that the sum of the frequencies for the five paint
removal practices equals 100 percent.

4.3.5.1 Estimating the Incremental Costs of Alternatives to Prohibited Work Practices
Power Sanding without attachment to HEPA Vacuum
It is assumed that if power sanding, grinding, or abrasive blasting is prohibited in opt-out housing for
renovations requiring lead-safe work practices under the rule, except when done with HEPA exhaust
control, renovators would use power tools with HEPA exhaust controls.
The costs of requiring that power sanders be attached to vacuums with HEPA filters includes: (1) the cost
of a sander capable of being attached to a HEPA vacuum, and (2) the cost of additional HEPA filters that
will be required because of the increased vacuum use. The cost of a HEPA vacuum is not included as an
incremental cost of this requirement since HEPA vacuum costs are already accounted for in the estimated
costs of complying with the cleaning requirements under the rule.
To estimate the cost of the HEPA vacuum compatible power sanders, quotes for 27 power sanders were
found through online queries; the average cost for such sanders was $209. It is assumed that each sander
can be used for at least 200 jobs. Most power sanders have one-year warranties, thus 200 jobs represents
the minimum lifespan. Therefore, the per-job cost of a new sander is $1.05 [$209/200].
The cost of extra HEPA filters was based on the cost of re-useable HEPA filters. Internet queries found
that re-useable filters cost between $30 and $38 each, with an average price of about $35. It is assumed
that each is good for the life of the sander (200 jobs), resulting in a cost per job of $.18 [$35/200].

Expected Lifespan (#

Per Job Cost
Power Sander $209 200 $1.05
HEPA Filter $35 200 $0.18
Sum of Sander and Filter $1.23
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning or Torching of Paint
It is assumed that if the use of high temperature heat guns (over 1,100 degrees F) and open flame burning
or torching of paint is prohibited for renovations in opt-out housing requiring lead-safe work practices
under the rule, renovators will use low temperature heat guns (under 1,100 degrees F) instead. The cost
of switching to low temperature heat guns is described below for typical interior and exterior painting
events where they may be used.
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning– Interior
An average interior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint removal from 144 sq. ft. of a 10’ x 10’
room. This calculation includes 3” molding around the ceiling, 6” baseboard, 1 doorway, and two 3’ x 5’
windows. It was estimated that this would take 1.05 hours using a high temperature heat gun and 1.36
hours using a low temperature heat gun.20 Thus, switching to a low temperature heat gun would require
20 According to Hunt (2006), a high temperature heat gun can remove the same amount of paint as dry scraping in 64
percent of the time required for dry scraping. It was estimated that dry scraping can be performed at a rate of
35-100 square feet per-hour, or 68 square feet per-hour on average (the rate of 35-100 square feet per-hour is
from Painting and Decorating Contractors of America, 2003). Based on personal communications with industry
sources, low-temperature heat gun paint removal takes 30 percent longer than high-temperature heat gun paint
removal.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-46
an additional 0.31 hours per job. At an hourly rate of $18/hr plus 60% overhead, the additional cost of
using a low temperature heat gun rather than a high temperature heat gun is $8.93 (PDCA 2003).
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning – Exterior
Assuming exterior paint removal from 2 doorways and 10 windows, the average event would include
paint removal from 243 sq. ft. It was estimated that this would take 1.77 hours using a high temperature
heat gun and 2.3 hours using a low temperature heat gun.21 Thus, switching to a low temperature heat
gun would require an additional 0.53 hours per job. At an hourly rate of $18/hr plus 60% overhead, the
incremental cost of using a low temperature heat gun is $15.26 per job. The cost of switching from using
open flame burning or torching of paint to a low temperature heat gun is assumed to be the same as for
switching from a high temperature heat gun to a low temperature heat gun.

An average interior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint removal from 144 sq. ft. of a 10’
x 10’ room. This calculation includes 3” molding around the ceiling, 6” baseboard, 1 doorway,
and two 3’ x 5’ windows. An average exterior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint
removal from 243 sq. ft., involving 2 doorways and 10 windows.
Estimating Average Costs Per Interior Painting and Exterior Painting Job
The sections above described how the average costs per event using a prohibited or restricted practice
were estimated. For cost estimating purposes an average cost across all jobs was estimated– including
those without prohibited practices. Table 4-32 presents these estimates.

*The average additional cost is a weighted average across all interior and exterior painting jobs, including those
where prohibited practices are not used (and additional costs are not incurred).
Interior open flame burning is combined with interior high temperature heat gun jobs (EPA 2008).
Low temperature heat guns are assumed to be the alternative to high temperature heat guns and open flame
burning. The alternative to power sanding not attached to a HEPA vacuum is assumed to be power sanding
attached to a HEPA vacuum.
4.3.6 Frequency and Cost of Vertical Containment for Exterior Events
In certain situations, the renovation firm must take extra precautions in containing the work area for opt-
out housing to ensure that dust and debris from an exterior renovation does not contaminate other
buildings or other areas of the property or migrate to adjacent properties. These situations include work
areas in close proximity to other buildings, work areas that abut a property line, and work in windy
conditions. In some cases, it may be necessary to erect a system of vertical containment to prevent paint
dust and debris from contaminating the ground or any object beyond the work area. Such vertical
containment could take a number of forms such as attaching plastic sheeting to a fence or other support at
the property line, attaching the plastic to a building or a frame attached to the building, or attaching the
plastic to scaffolding erected next to the building.
This section presents the calculations used to determine the total and incremental vertical containment
costs for events occurring along one side of a building or all four sides (referred to as 1 and 4-wall events)
in target housing units. The hanging of disposable reinforced plastic sheeting constitutes the largest
component of the vertical containment costs, so the average height of the buildings must be calculated to
determine the surface area of the sheeting.
Information from the 2005 American Housing Survey (AHS) was used to calculate the average height of
residential housing units. The AHS includes information on the number of stories in the buildings where
housing units are located. The average heights of owner occupied units and renter occupied units are just
under two stories and two-and-a-half stories, respectively.
In order to apply the average number of stories to the cost estimates, separate height estimates are needed
for: single-family owner occupied, single-family rental, and multi-family units. Data from the U.S.
Census Bureau’s American Factfinder was used to determine which average height values from Table 4-
33 to apply to these three categories of residential housing units using information on the percent of units
that are in single-family or multi-family buildings.

As shown in Table 4-34, the majority of owner-occupied housing units are in one-unit buildings. Thus
the average height of owner-occupied housing (2.0 stories) is used to characterize all single-family
housing and the average height of rental housing (2.5 stories) is used to characterize the height of multi-
family housing.

Table 4-36 presents the total and incremental costs of a vertical containment event involving either one or
four walls in the various residential housing units.22 It is assumed that vertical containment is used for 2%
of exterior painting events. To calculate the necessary amount of disposable reinforced plastic sheeting, it
was assumed that the workers would hang the sheeting not on the perimeter of the house but on the
perimeter of the laid polyethylene sheeting. Furthermore, it is assumed that for those jobs using vertical
containment, 50% of the events in residential units will not need scaffolding because they will use plastic
at the fence line or attached to the building, and that 50% of those events that do need scaffolding for
vertical containment are already using it for other reasons, and only incur incremental costs related to
plastic sheeting. Therefore only 25% of the residential units that undertake vertical containment will incur
incremental costs for scaffolding.
22 The analysis only considered one and four wall exterior events to capture the range of containment that might be required for
exterior painting events. Two or three wall events are also possible and would result in containment costs between those
estimated for the one and four wall events.

a. The scaffolding costs take into account the assumption that only 25% of residential housing units with vertical containment will need
incur incremental costs for scaffolding. It is assumed that the scaffolding is needed for one day per wall.
b. Based on a web search, which showed that reinforced plastic sheeting costs $.07 per square foot.
c. Based on a web search, which showed that duct tape costs $0.02 per square foot and 6 mil. polyethylene sheeting costs $0.06 per
square foot.
d. This includes both material and labor costs.
e. The average presented is the average across all exterior painting jobs, including the 98% of exterior painting jobs where vertical
containment is not assumed to be used.
Table 4-36 shows that the costs range in value from just over $760 for a one wall event in a single-family
renter occupied unit, to just under $6,250 for a four wall event in a multi-family housing unit. On average,
59% of the total cost is due to the labor involved with erecting and dismantling the scaffolding.
4.3.7 Baseline Work Practices
Some of the containment and cleaning practice standards specified by EPA under the rule are currently in
use by certain renovation contractors. The costs of work practices already in use are not incremental costs
of the rule and are subtracted out of the cost estimates. In order to determine how often the required work
practices are used in the absence of regulation, a telephone questionnaire was administered to 9
contractors in 2007 to collect information on baseline industry practices. A series of questions were
asked to determine if the listed work practices were currently in use and if they were, the frequency with
which they occur.
The questionnaire’s objective was to collect responses to two sets of questions. One set of questions dealt
with current interior RRP work practices. The other dealt with exterior work practices. The list of
contractors to contact was generated from Salesgenie.com, an online service that contains contact
information for over 14 million U.S. businesses. The service permitted companies to be selected based on
their SIC Codes. The universe of potential respondents was generated by randomly selecting businesses
with the following SIC Codes: 172101 (Painting Contractors), 1521 (General Contractors - Single-Family
Houses), and 1522 (General Contractors - Residential Buildings Other Than Single-Family). The
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-51
responding companies were comprised of four painting firms and five general contracting firms. All nine
of the painting and general contracting firms answered both the interior and exterior surveys. The
instrument used to administer the questionnaire is presented below (Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2).

(1) How often do you post signs warning residents to remain outside the work area?
(2) While the work is being performed, how often do you keep all windows and doors
within 20 feet of the work area closed, or covered with sheeting?
(3) How often do you cover the ground with sheeting in order to collect falling paint
debris?
Table 4-37 presents the individual results of the surveys as well as overall statistics for across the surveys.
The data are broken down by firm type (painting or general contracting), and survey type (interior or

Notes: When respondents gave a range of values for the percent of time they used a certain work practice, the midpoint of
the range was used in calculating the average. When the respondent was unable to give a response, a question mark is
presented and the value is excluded from the calculation.
Table 4-38 describes how the incremental cost adjustment is estimated to account for the use of required
work practices in the baseline. These calculations are based on the questionnaire responses and adjusted
to account for the assumption in this analysis that there will be 75 percent compliance with the rule. For
example, based on the average questionnaire response, signs are posted 34 percent of the time. Since it is
assumed that signs will be posted 75 percent of the time after the rule, 45 percent (45% = 34%/75%) of
the post-rule sign-posting costs are already incurred in the baseline. Thus, since it is estimated that
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-53
posting a sign costs $0.11 per-event, the incremental impact of the rule’s sign posting requirement is
$0.07 ($0.11 * (1-45%)) after adjusting for baseline sign posting

4.3.8 Summary of Incremental Work Practice Costs Per Event in Target Housing
Table 4-39 summarizes the incremental work practice costs associated with containment, cleaning, and
verification in target housing. The methodology behind these estimates is described in the preceding
sections and more detailed data is presented in Appendix 4A of the Economic Analysis of the 2008 LRRP
rule (EPA 2008). Table 4-40 shows the average expected costs per-compliant event, accounting for the
relative number of small and large events. These are average expected costs so some individual events
will be above the average and some will be below it.

Notes: The sum of the containment, cleaning and verification costs may not equal the total per-event cost due
to rounding. The costs associated with using prohibited practice alternatives are only included in the Total

4.3.9 Total Work Practice Costs Resulting from Removing Opt-Out Provisions
Table 4-40 through Table 4-43 present the total work practice costs associated with target housing
regulated under the revised rule (i.e., owner occupied housing that may no longer opt out of the LRRP
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-56
program requirements) for the first and second years after the revisions rule goes into effect. For
individual options the costs vary between the first and the second year for two primary reasons: (1) for
some options, the scope of the regulated universe expands between the first and the second year, and (2)
the improved test kits are assumed to become available by January 2011, which is the second year of the
rule for Options A through C. Increasing the scope of the regulated universe tends to increase costs and
the availability of the improved test kits tends to decrease the costs (since improved test kits will lower
the number of instances where LSWP costs are incurred when lead-based paint is not disturbed). After
the second year, estimated work practice costs decline proportionally to the assumed decline in the stock
of regulated buildings (a 0.41 percent decline per year). Note that the removal of the opt-out provision
would not begin until the second year under Option C.

4.4 Estimating the Number of Firms and Personnel Obtaining Training and
Certification to Meet the Demand for Lead-Safe RRP Services
The rule requires all entities that conduct RRP activities for compensation in regulated structures to
become certified under the rule. This analysis refers to these certified entities as firms. The regulations
also require firms to ensure that all persons performing renovation activities on behalf of the firm are
either certified renovators that have received formal training or have received informal training from a
certified renovator. Hereafter, “renovator” refers to an individual who has successfully completed a
renovator course accredited by EPA or an EPA-authorized State or Tribal program, and “worker” refers to
an individual who has received on-the-job training in the work practices from a certified renovator. It is
expected that two types of construction businesses will perform regulated RRP work – businesses with
employees and non-employer, or self-employed, contractors. In addition, rental companies are likely to
perform some of the RRP work on the properties they manage rather than hire an outside contractor.
Likewise, schools and daycare centers are likely to perform some or all of their RRP work with their own
staff. The regulation requires that a certified renovator be physically present when warning signs are
being posted, the work site is being contained, and when the post-renovation cleaning is being done. The
certified renovator must be available, either on-site or by telephone, at all other times when regulated
renovation activities are being performed. In addition, only a certified renovator may perform the
cleaning verification step required by the rule. As such, each certified firm with employees will need to

have at least one certified renovator on staff. All self-employed contractors performing regulated RRP
work will need to be trained as renovators and upon satisfying the training requirements, will need to be
certified as firms.
4.4.1 Residential Activities: Estimating the Number of Firms and Personnel Obtaining
Training and Certification to Meet the Demand for Lead-Safe RRP Services
This section describes how the analysis estimates the number of (1) firms obtaining certification, (2)
renovators obtaining formal training, and (3) workers obtaining informal on-the-job training in order to
meet the demand for lead-safe RRP services in residential settings. The general approach was to obtain
Census estimates of the total number of establishments and employees in affected industries and adjust
these estimates to account for the fact that not all work performed in these industries is affected by the
rule. Note that Census data are only available for establishments and not firms, and these data are used as
the basis for estimating the number of firms that will obtain certification. The total numbers of
establishments and employees are adjusted in two ways: (1) according to the share of their revenues that
come from residential work, and (2) to reflect the share of the housing stock that is affected by the LRRP
revisions rule. 23 These adjustments imply that there will be some degree of specialization in regulated
work. They do not, however, imply full specialization in regulated work. In addition, the adjustments do
not fully reflect the share of RRP work that does not disturb any painted surfaces, or the disproportionate
amount of residential work that is related to new construction. Adjusting for these two factors would
result in a lower estimate of the number of affected firms and personnel.
4.4.1.1 Estimating the Stock of Certified Firms Necessary to Meet Demand for Residential RRP
The numbers of firms seeking certification under the rule are estimated in three segments: (1) residential
construction establishments with employees, (2) non-employer residential construction establishments
(i.e., self-employed contractors), and (3) Residential Property Managers and Lessors. Residential
Property Managers and Lessors would not be affected by the removal of the opt-out provision (because
rental units were not eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule) but they would be
affected by the additional recordkeeping checklist requirement.
23 With respect to the second adjustment, it implies that by expanding the scope of the LRRP program (by removing the opt-out
provisions), the LRRP revisions will proportionately increase the number of certified firms and trained renovators and
workers, and thus the total training and certification costs for residential contractors. To the extent that firms are less
specialized than assumed here, more renovators and firms than originally predicted may become trained and renovated as a
result of the 2008 LRRP rule. In that case, the incremental training and certification cost of the LRRP revisions rule may be
less than this analysis estimates.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-61
Estimating the Number of Residential Construction Establishments with Employees
The LRRP revisions rule requires firms that conduct RRP activities in housing previously eligible for the
opt-out provision to become certified under the LRRP program rule. Because the majority of firms
involved in construction work are likely to be small, single establishment businesses, this analysis
assumes that firms will seek certification at the establishment level. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, the
eleven potentially affected construction sectors (Residential Remodelers and ten specialty contractor
sectors: Plumbing and HVAC, Tile and Terrazzo, Painting and Wall Covering, Finish Carpentry, Glass
and Glazing, Drywall and Insulation, Siding, Other Building Equipment, Other Building Finishing, and
Electrical contractors) include over 357,000 establishments with employees. Because these
establishments are involved in a variety of construction and non-construction activities, in all likelihood
only some of them will seek certification under the LRRP program rule. For example, only 54 percent of
Residential Remodeling establishments specialize in residential work (i.e. derive at least 51 percent of
their revenues from residential work). In addition, only 56 percent of the revenues of Residential
Remodelers come from residential RRP activities. Establishments may choose to incur the cost of
certification and of training their employees only if they derive a substantial portion of their revenues
from residential Renovation, Repair, and Painting in housing affected by the regulations. Businesses that
derive the majority of their revenues from new construction or from RRP activities in non-target housing
may decide not to invest in certification.
Unfortunately, the U.S. Economic Census does not provide data on the number of establishments that
specialize in residential RRP. The number of establishments estimated to specialize in residential RRP
was estimated by multiplying the total number of establishments by each industry sector’s ratio of RRP
residential revenues to total construction revenues (See Table 4-44).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-62
Estimating the Number of Non-Employer Residential Construction Firms
The number of self-employed (non-employer) firms in each of the eleven affected industry sectors is
presented in Table 4-45. It was assumed that these firms will specialize in residential work with the same
frequency as employer establishments in the same industry. In other words, to estimate the number of
self-employed contractors specializing in residential work, the estimated number of non-employer
establishments in each industry was multiplied by that industry’s ratio of residential RRP revenues to total
construction revenues (see Table 4-45).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-63
Estimating the Number of Property Managers and Lessors that Perform Residential RRP
Instead of hiring an outside contractor for RRP work on properties under their management, Residential
Property Managers (NAICS 531311) and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings (NAICS
531110) may choose to do the renovation work with their own staff. Since all firms performing RRP
work in regulated housing must be certified, establishments that choose to perform their own RRP work
will seek certifications under the regulations. The estimated numbers of these establishments are
presented in Table 4-46. Note that rental units and therefore Residential Property Managers and Lessors
of Residential Buildings and Dwellings are not affected by the opt-out provision, but would be subject to
the additional recordkeeping checklist requirement.
The U.S. Economic Census does not present any data on the amount of RRP work performed by
Residential Property Managers on their own properties. Due to this lack of data, this analysis assumes
that all Residential Property Management and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings
establishments that have paid employees and manage housing regulated by the rule will seek certification
and train their employees as certified renovators or workers. Although this assumption is likely to
overestimate the number of establishments and personnel seeking certification and training, it is not
unreasonable since performing minor renovation or maintenance work in-house is often less expensive
than hiring an outside contractor. The vast majority of establishments that manage regulated housing may

thus find certification worthwhile. Note that only establishments with employees are expected to seek
certification; non-employers are unlikely to have the time or manpower to perform renovations
themselves and are more likely to hire an outside contractor for work that disturbs more than 6 square feet
per room of a painted surface for interior renovations or 20 square feet for exterior renovations.

Summary of the Additional Number of Establishments Needed to Perform Residential RRP After
the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
Table 4-47 presents a summary of the estimated number of establishments specializing in residential
RRP. The estimated number of residential RRP establishments was further reduced to account for the fact
that only some of these entities will perform RRP work in target housing. The latter adjustment was
made based on data obtained from the American Housing Survey that 65 percent of U.S. households
reside in target housing.

The estimate that 373,968 firms perform residential RRP in pre-1978 housing represents the total stock of
firms that would be required to meet the potential demand for RRP using LSWP in all target housing. To
estimate the stock of certified firms under the various options, 373,968 is adjusted by 75 percent to
account for the 75 percent rate of compliance assumed in this analysis. In addition, the compliance-
adjusted estimate is adjusted to reflect the scope of each regulatory option, based on the percentage of all
target housing RRP events regulated under each option. The removal of the opt-out provision from the
final LRRP rule would affect entities performing RRP work in owner-occupied target housing units that
are not COFs and where no child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides. The estimated stock

Estimating the Stock of Trained Construction Workers Necessary to Meet Demand for Residential
RRP
The rule requires certified firms to ensure that renovation activities covered by the rule are performed by
certified renovators, or by renovation workers who receive on-the-job training in the work practices from
a certified renovator. The regulation requires that a certified renovator be physically present when
warning signs are being posted, the work site is being contained, and during post-renovation cleaning.
The certified renovator must be available, either on-site or by telephone, at all other times when regulated
renovation activities are being performed. In addition, only a certified renovator may perform the
cleaning verification step required by the rule. As such, each certified establishment with employees will
need to have at least one certified renovator on staff. All self-employed contractors performing regulated
RRP work will need to be trained as renovators and upon satisfying the training requirements, will need
to be certified as firms.
Estimating the Number of Residential Construction Employees (excluding self-employed)
To estimate the number of construction employees that will train to become certified renovators, this
analysis looked at the average number of construction employees in establishments performing residential
RRP jobs. The average employment size was calculated by dividing the number of construction
employees seeking training by the number of establishments certified in each industry (See Table 4-49).
This analysis also assumed that establishments will employ one certified renovator per every five
construction employees. In other words, establishments that have one to five construction workers on
staff will employ one renovator, establishments with more than five and fewer than 10 construction
workers on staff will employ two renovators, and those with 10 or more construction workers on staff will
employ three renovators. The average number of construction workers per establishment was no higher
than 15 in any affected sector.
To estimate the number of construction employees that would be trained as renovators, the estimated
number of establishments seeking certification in each sector was multiplied by the expected number of
renovators per establishment for that sector (see Table 4-49 and Table 4-50). Four of the affected sectors
(Other Building Equipment Contractors, Other Building Finishing Contractors, Electrical Contractors and
Drywall and Insulation Contractors) had, on average, between 10 and 15 construction employees per
establishment and were assumed to have three renovators on staff each. The number of construction
employees in each sector that will need to receive worker training was estimated by subtracting the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-66
number of people receiving renovator certification from the total number of people seeking training (see
Table 4-50).
The number of employee establishment personnel expected to seek training as either certified renovators
or workers was estimated by applying the same approach used for the estimation of the number of
establishments that will seek certification under the regulations (note: employee establishment personnel
does not include the self-employed). It was assumed that the number of people who perform RRP work in
each of the affected industries is proportional to the ratio of residential RRP revenues to the total
construction revenues in that sector. In other words, it was assumed that since 28 percent of construction
revenues in the Tile and Terrazzo contractor industry come from residential RRP, then 28 percent of the
construction employees perform residential RRP work. The number of employees estimated to specialize
in residential RRP was estimated by multiplying the total number of employees by each industry sector’s
ratio of RRP residential revenues to total construction revenues (See Table 4-50).

the fact that Residential Property Manager establishments are involved in a variety of non-construction
activities; it is thus unlikely that these businesses will have more than one ten-person construction crew
on staff. Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings establishments employ about five people on

4.4.1.2 Estimating the Increase in the Number of Firms and Personnel Seeking Certification and
Training Each Year After the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
The number of renovators and firms that seek training and certification in the first few years is estimated
slightly differently for the option with a phase-in period (Option D) as it is for those that do not phase-in
regulated structures in the second year (Options A and C). Further, Option B, which would implement
the revised rule midway through the first year, is calculated similarly to an option with a phase-in period.
The methodology employed to estimate the stock of renovators and firms required to meet the demand for
lead-safe RRP services is described above and the results are summarized in Table 4-48. The number of
firms and individuals seeking training and certification in any given year is estimated from the stock of
firms and individuals necessary to meet demand for lead-safe RRP services. (Because training and
certification are valid for five years, the annual number trained and certified each year after the first year
is a fraction of the total stock of trained individuals and certified firms.) The differences in the number of
renovators and firms seeking training and certification across the options are proportional to the number
of RRP events regulated by each option..
Note that many of the additional firms and renovators that expected to become certified and trained
because of the removal of the opt-out provision are likely to seek certification and training before the
removal of the opt-out provision goes into effect. (So, for example, under Option C, it is unlikely that
there would actually be zero firms certified or renovators trained in the first year after promulgation of the
rule.) However, this analysis utilizes the simplifying assumption that any additional initial certification
and training takes place over a 12 month period starting from the date of the expansion of the regulated
universe.
Options Without Phase-In (Options A and C)
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the increase in demand for lead-
safe RRP services in that first year. Thus, under options A and C, the number of initial trainings and
certifications in the year the opt-out provision is removed is equal to the stock of renovators and firms
required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe RRP services associated with all owner-occupied
target housing units where no child under age six or pregnant woman resides. After the first year, it is
assumed that one-fifth of the necessary stock of individuals and firms will obtain training and certification
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-69
each year (since refresher-training and re-certification is required every five years). In addition, the
number of individuals trained is assumed to decline by 0.41 percent annually to account for the decline in
the size of the pre-1978 housing stock over time, and thus the decline in demand for lead-safe renovation
services. The entire stock of workers is assumed to receive informal training each year.
Options With Phase-In (Option D):
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP
services in that first year. Under Option D, the number of initial trainings and certifications in the first
year is equal to the stock of renovators and firms required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe
RRP services associated with all owner-occupied pre-1960 housing units where no child under age six or
pregnant woman resides. In the second year, this analysis makes the simplifying assumption that one-fifth
of the number who were trained and certified in the first year will seek initial- or re-certification (adjusted
by 0.41 percent annually to reflect the decline in the stock of pre-1978 buildings), and that the stock of
individuals and firms required to meet the additional demand in the newly regulated 1960 to 1978
structures will obtain initial training and certification. In later years, it is assumed that one-fifth of the
necessary stock of individuals and firms will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-
training and re-certification is required every five years). The entire stock of workers is assumed to
receive informal training each year.
Options With Partial-Year Implementation (Option B):
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the increased demand for lead-
safe RRP services in that first year. Under Option B, the rule does not become effective until halfway
through the first year. Thus, under Option B, the stock of renovators and firms seeking initial training and
certification in the first year is half as large as that required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe
RRP services in all pre-1978 structures during a full year. In the second year, this analysis makes the
simplifying assumption that one-fifth of the number who were trained and certified in the first year will
seek initial- or re-certification (adjusted by 0.41 percent annually to reflect the decline in the stock of pre-
1978 buildings). In addition, the stock of individuals and firms required to meet the additional demand
for a full year’s renovations (rather than the six months in the first year) will obtain initial training and
certification. In later years, it is assumed that one-fifth of the necessary stock of individuals and firms
will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-training and re-certification is required
every five years). The entire stock of workers is assumed to receive informal training each year.
Training and Certification after the Initial Years
As indicated above, this analysis assumes a steady annual number of firm and individual certifications
after the second year of regulation with an annual decline of 0.41 percent. If all the individuals and firms
needed to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP were trained and certified in the first and second years, one
might expect a drop in the level of training and certification in the third year, followed by a spike in the
next year. That is, one might expect a cyclical pattern of training and certification to emerge. However,
it is difficult to predict how cyclical the training and certification demand might be or how this cyclicality
might diminish over time. Therefore, this analysis assumes that a typical amount of training and
certification occurs each year after the first two years. Modeling a cyclical component would add little to
the analysis without being able to estimate the extent of any cyclicality more precisely.
The analysis does account for certified firms and trained individuals that exit the industry each year and
are replaced by new entrants. This analysis accounts for turnover in the regulated RRP industry by
assuming a certain percentage of certifications each year are initial certifications. Specifically, after the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-70
first year, 52 percent of the renovators seeking training and certification are assumed to be seeking their
initial certification. This percentage is based on the relative number of Abatement Supervisors applying
for initial certifications according to the Federal Lead-Based Paint Program (FLPP) database (EPA 2005).
Similarly, 54 percent of firms seeking certification are assumed to be seeking their initial certification
based on the relative frequency of initial certifications observed for abatement firms in the FLPP
database.
Summary of Number of Individuals Trained to Perform Residential RRP using LSWP
Table 4-52 presents a summary of the estimated number of construction renovators and workers
specializing in residential RRP. The estimated number of residential RRP renovators and workers was
further reduced to account for the fact that only some of these individuals will perform RRP work in
target housing. The latter adjustment was made based on data obtained from the American Housing
Survey that 65 percent of U.S. households reside in target housing.

The estimated number of renovators and workers that perform residential RRP in pre-1978 housing,
426,038 and 636,787, respectively, represents the estimated stock of renovators and workers that would
be required to meet the demand for RRP in target housing (This includes renovations covered by the 2008
LRRP rule as well as the LRRP revisions rule). To estimate the stock of trained individuals under the
various options, these estimates are adjusted by 75 percent to account for the 75 percent rate of
compliance assumed in this analysis. In addition, the compliance-adjusted estimate is further adjusted to
reflect the scope of each regulatory option based on the percentage of all target housing RRP events
regulated under each option. For example, the increase in the stock of trained renovators under Option A
(126,940) is estimated by multiplying the estimated stock of renovators that would be required to meet the
demand for RRP in all target housing (426,038) by the compliance rate (75 percent) and the percentage of
target housing RRP events regulated under Option A (35 percent). The removal of the opt-out provision
from the 2008 LRRP rule would require that RRP is performed by trained renovators and workers in
owner-occupied target housing units that are not COFs and where no child under the age of six or a
pregnant woman resides. The estimated increase in the stock of renovators and workers that would be

Note: Components may not add up to totals due to rounding. The number of firms and individuals certified and
trained, respectively, are assumed to decline by 0.41 percent annually to account for the decline in the size of the
regulated housing stock over time, and thus the demand for lead-safe renovation services. This table presents the
numbers of renovators and firms seeking training and certification in a given year; therefore the numbers in years 2 and
3 differ from those presented in Table 4-48, which presents the stock of trained renovators and certified firms. Because
training and certification are valid for five years, the stock of certified firms and trained individuals exceeds the annual
number trained and certified each year after Year 1. Workers receive training each year.
See Table 4-1 for options descriptions.

4.5 Training Costs
Training costs include the cost of the time spent on training activities as well as the associated travel and
tuition costs. Note that tuition costs are assumed to include the costs associated with training provider
accreditation. In other words, it is assumed that accredited training providers pass along their
accreditation fees and other administrative costs through their tuition. These accreditation fees and other
administrative costs are estimated in the paperwork burden analysis but are only implicitly accounted for
(as part of tuition costs) in the estimates of the total cost of the rule.
4.5.1 Training Burden Per Individual
To estimate the incremental burden of training, several cost components are calculated, including tuition
rates, wage rates, and travel and expense costs. Each certified renovator will participate in 8 hours of
formal initial training. Refresher renovator certification training is required every five years; the refresher
course is only four hours. Workers receive informal, on-the-job training; it is assumed that, on average,
three workers are trained at a time by a certified renovator and the training requires one hour.
Tuition for the initial certified renovator training class is estimated to be $186; the corresponding
refresher course tuition is estimated to be $93 (EPA 2006). This estimate relies on the assumption that
the average hourly tuition is equal to the observed rates for the accredited lead abatement and evaluation
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-73
courses ($23.26/hr).24 Additional travel and meal costs associated with training are assumed to be $121
(EPA 2006).25 Digital photos of each certified renovator are also added into the additional costs. The
total cost for a one-time use digital camera that takes 25 pictures is $14 ($0.56 per picture taken). The
total time allotted to taking and processing these photos is estimated at 3 minutes ($1.20). A total cost of
$1.76 (rounded to $2 in the total cost estimates) is therefore estimated. For a class size of 10 students, 3
minutes per student is equivalent to a total time of 30 minutes to take the digital photos, associate them
with the appropriate students, and insert the photos onto the training certificates.
The value of the time for certified renovators to receive formal initial training is $253 (8 hours at a loaded
wage rate of $31.64/hour); the refresher training is half this amount, or $127 (EPA 2006). Certified
renovators may be self-employed or might be employed by a larger company. Therefore, the value of
time is likely to represent a mix of lost wages and additional overhead to firms. Assuming one certified
renovator trains three workers at a time and this informal training requires an hour, informal training is
estimated to cost $27 per worker trained, based on the renovator wage rate and an average loaded wage
rate for workers of $16.94/hour (EPA 2006). Thus, as shown in Table 4-55, the aggregated incremental
cost of training is $560 for initial certified renovator training, $341 for refresher certified renovator
training and $27 for informal worker training (EPA 2006).

4.5.2 Total Training Costs
Table 4-56 through Table 4-58 present the total training costs of the rule for the first three years. The
number of renovators and workers seeking training is described in Section 4.4.1.2, the value of training
time for renovators and workers is described in Section 4.5.1. The average training cost per renovator
varies in the initial years of the regulation according to the relative number of initial and refresher
trainings. After the second year, 52 percent of contractors and public or commercial building renovators
receive initial training (due to turnover in the industry) and the rest obtain refresher training. Note that an
individual who received initial training and let their certification expire must retake the initial training.
The stock of regulated structures declines by 0.41 percent annually which also reduces the demand for
lead-safe renovation services, and thus the number of renovators and workers seeking training and the
undiscounted total training costs.
24 The average of the hourly tuition rates are used rather than picking a single similar course because no single
course is similar enough to the renovator course. For example, the initial courses are the only courses with
hands-on training, but they are also longer than the renovator course. The refresher courses are more similar in
length, but have no hands on requirements.
25 Travel costs include 2 hours of travel time ($63), meals ($9), and mileage costs (50 miles, $49).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-75
4.6 Certification Costs: Firm Paperwork Burden and EPA Administrative and
Enforcement Costs
Under this rule, states are given the option of administering the regulations as long as the state
implementation plan is approved by EPA. EPA will directly administer programs in states that do not
have an approved implementation plan. This section of the analysis estimates costs that EPA expects to
incur while administrating and enforcing the LRRP rule under the assumption that EPA administers the
program everywhere. States that choose to implement the rule themselves are expected to incur similar
costs in lieu of EPA. Firm paperwork costs associated with certification are also presented in this section.
EPA will perform three tasks as part of administering the LRRP rule: accrediting training providers,
certifying firms, and processing training provider notifications. In addition to administrative costs, EPA
will also incur costs to enforce the LRRP rule. To reduce the burden on the regulated community, EPA
has decided not to require formal certification for renovators and workers.
In the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule, EPA estimated enforcement costs independently from
firm certification costs. However, for this analysis, EPA adopted firm certification fees set forth in a
separate rulemaking. Under this fee schedule, enforcement costs are assumed to be variable and captured
by the certification fees paid by firms.
Accreditation/certification cost estimates are based on the 2009 rule that set fees for accreditation of
training programs and certification of lead-based paint activities and renovation contractors (EPA 2009).
This analysis utilizes the $300 per firm fees set for initial certification and re-certification. Note that there
are also administrative and enforcement costs related to accrediting training providers but these costs are
also assumed to be recovered through tuition charges and are therefore accounted for through the tuition
costs.
4.6.1 Administrative and Enforcement Costs: Contribution to Total Costs
The fees that firms and training providers pay to become certified and accredited, respectively, are
designed to recover EPA’s administrative and enforcement costs. These fees were set in a separate
rulemaking (74 Federal Register 11863, March 20, 2009, codified at 40 CFR '745.92). Simply adding
these costs to the other cost components, however, will result in some double counting. This analysis
assumes that training providers will recover their accreditation fees (which in turn cover EPA’s
administrative and enforcement costs of training provider accreditation) through the tuition they charge to
renovators. Those costs have already been accounted for in Section 4.5 Thus, the additional social cost
of EPA’s administrative and enforcement activities can be calculated based on the fees firms pay to
become certified. The EPA costs that will be recovered from RRP firms in a given year are calculated as
follows:
4.6.2 Firm Paperwork Burden
It is estimated that firms will spend a total of three hours to familiarize themselves with the LRRP rule’s
requirements and a half an hour to fill out and mail the one-page application for renovator certification.
In addition, each year time is spent keeping records that demonstrate compliance with the LRRP training
and work-practice requirements. Additional costs are minor and include: one application printout, one
photocopy for personal records, an envelope, and a stamp. As shown in Table 4-60, it is estimated that

4.6.3 Total Certification Costs: Increase in Firm Paperwork and EPA Administrative and
Enforcement Costs Associated with the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
Table 4-60 shows the total certification costs for the LRRP rule revision in the first year. Table 4-61 and
Table 4-62 show the total certification costs by initial certification firms, refresher certification firms, and
firms not seeking certification for the LRRP rule revision in the second and third years, respectively. The
certification costs decline by 0.41 percent each year after the third year, accounting for the expected
decline in regulated universe as older housing units are replaced with newer structures. Total costs per-
firm are the sum of EPA’s administrative costs per firm and the firm’s costs for paperwork and
recordkeeping. This cost per firm is multiplied by the additional number of establishments estimated to
provide lead-safe RRP services as a result of the removal of the opt-out provision (see Section 4.4.1.1).
In the first year, all the firms listed in the number of establishments’ column in Table 4-60 are presumed
to seek initial certification, paying their share of EPA’s administrative and enforcement costs ($300 per
firm, see Section 4.6.1). In addition, they incur a cost for paperwork and recordkeeping. The tables
reflect only those additional firms that are expected to become certified as a result of the removal of the
opt-out provision.

estimated based on the costs presented in Table 4-61 and Table 4-62 and the relative number of firms
seeking initial-certification, re-certification, and not seeking certification. Section 4.4.1.1 describes and
presents these estimates. The increase in the number of establishments is shown for firms seeking initial
certification, recertification, and not seeking certification.

4.7 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Costs
4.7.1 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Requirements
The proposed revision to the 2008 LRRP rule would require all renovation firms to provide a copy of the
records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the RRP rule to the
owner and, if different, the occupant of the building being renovated or the operator of the child-occupied
facility. Renovation firms would have to provide this information to owners and occupants when the final
invoice for the renovation is delivered, or within thirty days of the completion of work, whichever is
earlier. It is expected that renovators will furnish this information by providing a copy of the short
checklist or other form that is used for compliance purposes, and thus it is referred to here as a checklist.
If dust clearance is performed in lieu of cleaning verification, the renovation firm must also provide a
copy of the dust wipe sampling report(s). For renovations occurring in common areas of target housing or
child-occupied facilities, the renovation firm can post instructions to tenants on how to obtain the
information.
The checklist or form must include documentation that a certified renovator was assigned to the project,
that the certified renovator provided on-the-job training for workers used on the project, that the certified
renovator performed or directed workers who performed the tasks required by this final rule, and that the
certified renovator performed the post-renovation cleaning verification. It must also include the
identifying information on the manufacturer and model of the test kits used, if any; a description of the
components that were tested including their locations; and the test kit results. This documentation must
include a certification by the certified renovator that the work practices were followed with descriptions
as applicable (see Figure 4-3 for a sample recordkeeping checklist).

4.7.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Unit Costs
4.7.2.1 Labor Costs
Under the requirements of the 2008 LRRP rule, renovation firms must complete and retain a copy of the
information described above for enforcement purposes. Therefore, the LRRP revisions rule would only
result in renovation firms incurring the incremental labor costs of photocopying and distributing the
checklist to the owners and/or occupants. The burden will be minimal, since the renovator will typically
be delivering the checklist along with an invoice or other job-relate paperwork. EPA assumed that
photocopying and distributing the checklist would take an average of three minutes of a renovator’s time
at a loaded wage rate of $31.64 per hour, for an average cost of $1.58.
4.7.2.2 Material Costs
The checklist provision requires renovation firms to supply a copy of the checklist to the owner of the
affected building, or if different, the occupant of the affected target housing unit or operator of the child-
occupied facility, and to post the checklist in a common area. Therefore, renovation firms performing
work in target housing or public or commercial buildings would incur an incremental cost of photocopy
materials.
Table 4-63 shows the estimated average costs per event of the checklist provision requirements.
4.7.3 Number of Events Affected by the Checklist Provision
The recordkeeping checklist provision would apply to both firms affected by the 2008 LRRP rule and to
firms that would be covered by the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision. Under Option A, the
entire stock of firms necessary to meet demand, including those working in target housing, and public or
commercial building COFs, would incur checklist costs in the first year. However, under Options B and
C, which have delayed implementation, and Option D, which has a phase-in period, only some of the
incremental stock of firms ultimately affected by the removal of the opt-out provision would incur costs
in the first year. That is, there would be no delay in providing the checklist for events covered by the
2008 LRRP rule; for options with a delayed effective date or phase-in, the checklist provision requirement
would take effect at the same time as the LRRP work practice requirements. From the second year
onward, the entire stock of firms would incur checklist provision costs.
As mentioned above, firms performing work in owner-occupied target housing would be required to
distribute one copy of the checklist while firms performing work in renter-occupied target housing would
be required to provide a copy to the owner and occupant. If the work occurs in the common area of an

apartment building, the checklist, or information on how to obtain the checklist, can be posted on a sign in
the common area.
The checklist provision also applies to firms performing work in public or commercial building COFs.
Child-occupied facilities that perform work themselves must post the checklist, or information on how to
obtain the checklist, on a sign that is accessible to parents or guardians of the children. Similarly,
landlords that perform work would have to supply one copy of the checklist attached to a sign in the area
where the work is being performed. Contractors who perform work in owner-occupied COFs must
provide two copies of the checklist: one copy to the owner of the COF and one copy to be posted on a
sign in the COF. In addition to the two copies required in owner-occupied events, contractors working in
renter-occupied COFs must also provide the operator of the COF with a third copy of the checklist.

4.7.4 Total Costs of the Recordkeeping Checklist Provision
Table 4-65 presents the total costs imposed on firms as a result of the recordkeeping checklist provision in
the first and second years of the rule’s implementation under each option with the costs that would be
incurred without the elimination of the opt-out provision (costs of events regulated under the 2008 LRRP
rule). EPA estimated total costs by multiplying unit costs in Table 4-63 with the corresponding number
of events in Table 4-64.
4.8 Total Costs
This section presents the total costs of the revisions to the LRRP program. Total costs are estimated for
the first, second, and third years of regulation. Total 50-year costs and 50-year annualized costs are also
calculated. Out year costs are estimated using discount rates of both 3 and 7 percent.
4.8.1 Total Costs in the First Year of Regulation
Table 4-66 presents the total first year costs associated with the LRRP rule. Total containment, cleaning,
and verification costs are calculated by adding the cost of testing using the LBP test kits to the costs of
containment, cleaning, and verification. The total costs of containment, cleaning, and verification are
calculated by multiplying the number of events requiring work practices (Section 4.2) by the
corresponding incremental unit costs (Section 4.3). The total cost of conducting LBP tests using test kits

is removed, including the checklist cost for the 2008 LRRP Rule Events. The cost for events affected by the opt-
out removal can be calculated by subtracting the cost for the 2008 LRRP Rule Events from the cost for each

is estimated as the number of events (Section 4.2) multiplied by the cost of conducting the test (see
Section 4.3.1). Total training costs are calculated by multiplying the number of trained individuals
(Section 4.4) by the corresponding incremental training costs (Section 4.5.1). Total certification costs are
calculated by multiplying the number of firms (Section 4.4) by the corresponding incremental firm costs
(Section 4.6). The recordkeeping checklist provision costs are calculated by multiplying the number of
events where a recordkeeping checklist must be provided (Section 4.7.3) by the corresponding unit cost of
providing the recordkeeping checklist (Section 4.7.2).
The total costs are higher in the first year for the options that regulate more RRP events. First year costs
are highest under Option A ($507 million), which fully eliminates the opt-out provision immediately.
First year costs are second highest under Option D ($291 million), which fully eliminates the opt-out
provision for pre-1960 housing as soon as the rule is implemented. The costs under Option B ($263
million), which fully eliminates the opt-out provision midway through the first year, are slightly lower
compared to Option D. Option C first year total costs ($20 million) only include recordkeeping checklist
provision costs for events covered by the 2008 LRRP rule in the first year.

4.8.2 Total Costs in the Second and Third Years of Regulation
Table 4-67 and Table 4-68 show that total costs differ across options in the second year but are the same
across all options by the third year. Despite the second year expansion of the number of regulated events
under Option D, the total work practice costs are only slightly higher than in the first year. This modest
increase results from the improved effectiveness of the test kit (decrease in false positive rate of 63
percent to 10 percent), which offsets a portion of the cost increase associated with the larger universe of
regulated events.
In the second year, the training and certification costs are highest under Option C and are relatively higher
under Option B and Option D compared to Option A. This ranking reflects the delayed start-up costs
associated with training and certifying the additional individuals and firms needed to meet the demand
increase that corresponds to the expansion in the regulated universe in the second year. From the third
year forward, training and certification costs are the same under all options.

4.8.3 Total 50-Year and 50-Year Annualized Costs
The total costs are also calculated discounted over a 50-year period. Discounting refers to the economic
conversion of future costs (and benefits) to their present values, accounting for the fact that society tends
to value future costs or benefits less than comparable near-term costs or benefits. Discounting is
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-85
important when the values of costs or benefits occur over a multiple year period and may vary from year
to year. Discounting enables the accumulation of the cost and benefit values from multiple years at a
single point in time, accounting for the difference in how society values those costs and benefits
depending on the year in which the values are estimated to occur.
The 50-year costs were estimated by developing a profile of the compliance costs associated with each
option over a 50-year period. (The 50-year period was chosen to be consistent with the economic analysis
done for the TSCA Section 403 Lead-Based Paint Hazard Standards.) The profile of costs over time was
developed by estimating an annual decline in pre-1978 housing stock of 0.41 percent per-year and
assuming that the regulated universe would decrease by that rate every year. That rate was calculated
using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock using data from the
1990 and 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Census Bureau 1990 and 2000c). This rate affects costs because
it decreases the number of events and number of workers trained every year.
As discussed above, first year training and certification costs account for the training and certification of
all renovators and firms to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP services in the first year. For Option B
and Option D, it is assumed that the additional individuals and firms will obtain training and certification
in the second year to meet the increase in demand associated with the larger number of regulated RRP
events in the second year. In subsequent years, it is assumed that one fifth of the necessary stock of
individuals and firms will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-training and re-
certification is required every five years).
In fact, if all the individuals and firms needed to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP are trained and
certified in the first and second years, one might expect a drop in the level of training and certification in
the third year followed by a spike in the future years. That is, one might expect a cyclical pattern of
training and certification to emerge. This analysis assumes a typical amount of training and certification
occurs each year because modeling such a trend would add little to the analysis without being able to
precisely estimate the extent of any cyclicality.
The total 50-year costs and the 50-year annualized costs are discounted using rates of 3 and 7 percent.
These discount rate values reflect guidance from the Office of Management and Budget regulatory
analysis guidance document, Circular A-4 (OMB, 2003).
The following formula was used to calculate the present value (PV) of the time stream of costs:
PV = )1(
,
)1(  t
tx
r
Cost
where:
Costt = Costs in year t;
r = Discount rate (3 percent and 7 percent); and
t = Year in which cost is incurred.
This analysis also presents the 50-year annualized costs of the rule. Conceptually, the 50-year annualized
cost is the level annual payment that one would have to make to pay off a debt equal to the present value
total 50-year cost for a given interest rate (the discount rate).
The following formula is used to calculate the 50-year annualized cost.

Table 4-69 shows the present value of the total 50-year costs, and Table 4-70 shows the annualized 50-
year costs for the options considered. Because the test kits available for the first year (i.e., starting in June
2010) have a high false positive rate, including the newer housing units in the regulated universe before
improved test kits are available is relatively costly. This is because the high rate of false positives will
require many units without LBP to use the more costly work practices.

4.9 Alternative Regulatory Options: Options E1 – E4
Options A through D differ only in the timing of how the regulated universe is covered. This section
presents cost estimates for various work practice alternatives to Option A, including: (1) requiring interior
containment without any cleaning or verification requirements, (2) requiring interior cleaning without any
containment or verification requirements, (3) requiring interior cleaning and verification without any
interior containment requirements, and (4) no ban on prohibited practices and no exterior vertical
containment requirements. Like Option A, these options would become effective June 2010, and would
be applied to all pre-1978 housing eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule. In
addition, the requirement for the renovator to provide the recordkeeping checklist to the owners and
occupants would apply in both the renovations covered by the 2008 LRRP rule and those formerly
eligible for the opt-out provision. Options E1 to E4 cover the same number of renovation events as
Option A, and result in the same number of renovators being trained and firms certified. Thus, Options
E1 to E4 have the same training, certification, and checklist costs as Option A, but the work practice costs
differ from Option A.
4.9.1 Alternative Interior Containment, Cleaning, and Verification Requirements
Section 4.3 presents the work practice unit costs for the following three components: (1) containment, (2)
cleaning, and (3) verification. Under the alternative regulatory options presented in Table 4-71, not all of
these work practice components are required and therefore compliance costs are lower. Not requiring any
interior cleaning or verification, but requiring rule containment, lowers the total annualized costs by about
12 percent compared to Option A. Requiring rule-style interior cleaning and verification, but not
requiring interior containment also lowers the annualized total costs of the rule by 12 percent compared to
Option A. Not requiring any interior containment or verification, but requiring rule-style cleaning, results
in the largest decline in total annualized costs of about 17 percent compared to Option A.

4.9.2 Regulatory Alternative without a Paint Removal Practice Prohibition
This alternative regulatory option has the same scope and work practice requirements as Option A, except
that there is no prohibition or restriction on open-flame burning or torching of LBP; operating a heat gun
on LBP at 1100° F or higher; or using machines that remove LBP through high speed operation (such as
sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting) without HEPA exhaust
control. As shown in Table 4-72, if the rule allows these paint removal practices to continue to be used,
total annualized costs for the option would be 1 percent lower than for Option A.

 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-1    
5. Benefits of the Revisions to the LRRP Rule  
This chapter presents a discussion of the benefits associated with reducing lead exposure by revising the 
lead, renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations.  The proposed revisions to the LRRP 
program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision (currently available for owner-occupied target 
housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence and where the 
housing is not a COF), and (2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their 
recordkeeping checklist to owners and occupants of renovated structures. 
An overview of the opt-out provision, as it applies to this benefits estimation, is provided in Section  5.1.  
Section  5.2 presents calculated values meant to serve as a proxy for the magnitude of benefits under this 
action.  Section  5.3 includes a discussion of the benefits of the additional recordkeeping checklist 
provision requirement.  Finally, in Section  5.4, the human health and ecological consequences of lead 
exposure are summarized.   
The proposed work practices, training and certification requirements for the housing units previously 
eligible for the opt-out provision will reduce lead exposure by increasing the containment and cleanup of 
dust and debris generated by renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) activities.  Additional reductions in 
lead exposure will be achieved by prohibiting the use of certain paint preparation and removal techniques 
in jobs that require lead-safe work practices.  These reductions in exposure will in turn reduce the risks of 
adverse health and ecological effects in the vicinity of these activities.  
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of 
medical observation and scientific research.  Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body 
and is toxic to many organ systems.  As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on 
several organ systems.  A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in 
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them.  Young children (from birth through age five) 
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently 
measured by IQ change).  EPA’s Air Quality Criteria for Lead (EPA 2006b) provided a thorough review 
of the available science on lead-related health and ecological effects.  An excerpt from the Executive 
Summary is provided in section  5.4 of this analysis. 
With regard to potential implications of lead effects on IQ, the Criteria Document recognizes the 
‘‘critical’’ distinction between population and individual risk, identifying issues regarding declines in IQ 
for an individual and for the population. The Criteria Document further states that a ‘‘point estimate 
indicating a modest mean change on a health index at the individual level can have substantial 
implications at the population level’’ (CD, p. 8–77).  A downward shift in the mean IQ value is associated 
with both substantial decreases in percentages achieving very high scores and substantial increases in the 
percentage of individuals achieving very low scores (AQCD, p. 8–81).  For an individual functioning in 
the low IQ range due to the influence of developmental risk factors other than lead, a lead-associated IQ 
decline of several points might be sufficient to drop that individual into the range associated with 
increased risk of educational, vocational, and social failure (AQCD, p. 8–77).   
Other cognitive effects observed in studies of children have included effects on attention, executive 
functions, language, memory, learning and visuospatial processing (AQCD, sections 5.3.5, 6.2.5 and 
8.4.2.1), with attention and executive function effects associated with lead exposures indexed by blood 
lead levels below 10 µg/dL (AQCD, section 6.2.5 and pp. 8–30 to 8–31). The evidence for the role of lead 
in this suite of effects includes experimental animal findings (discussed in AQCD, section 8.4.2.1; p. 8–
31), which provide strong biological plausibility of lead effects on learning ability, memory and attention 
(AQCD, section 5.3.5), as well as associated mechanistic findings.  
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-2    
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and 
expected earnings (Salkever 1995).   Based on Salkever’s coefficients, the estimated value of an IQ point 
is $12,953 (2005 dollars).  This IQ value is modeled as the present value of a loss in expected lifetime 
earnings due to a one point IQ drop.  The present value is calculated assuming that children would be 
affected by lead at 3 years of age, the median of the range when children are most susceptible to lead 
hazards; that while most people start working at age 18, average income in the early adult years is 
reduced because some are still in school; and that retirement occurs at the age of 67.  This estimated value 
of an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as 
additional education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels 
of lead.   
Both epidemiologic and toxicological studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead 
affect many different organ systems (EPA 2006b, p.E-8).  It appears that some of these effects, 
particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's neurobehavioral 
development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a threshold (EPA 2004).   
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased 
hypertension (EPA 2006b).  Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are among 
those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or possibly 
lower); and these categories of effects are currently clearly of greatest public health concern (EPA 2006b, 
p 8-60). Other newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups 
are also emerging as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern (EPA 2006b, p 8-
60).   
Some studies have examined the question of whether the neurological effects of exposures in early 
childhood are ameliorated when blood-lead levels decline.  The data are mixed on this issue.  In a study 
that treated lead-exposed children with a chelating agent, Ruff (1993) found that children whose blood-
lead levels had the greatest decline showed the most improvement in cognitive scores.  In contrast, Rogan 
(2001) found that treatment with a chelating agent lowered blood-lead levels in children but did not 
appear to improve neurological function.  Liu (2002) also found that chelation therapy at age 2, while 
lowering blood-lead levels, did not improve neurological function in children at 5 years of age.  While the 
study did detect a relationship between declining blood-lead and improved neurological function, this 
association was observed only in the untreated group, leading the authors to speculate that some other 
factor besides declining lead levels from chelation therapy (such as greater parental involvement), led to 
the neurological gains.  Dietrich (2004) had similar findings in the same cohort of children at 7 years of 
age.  One study cited in ATSDR (1999) showed impaired motor and cognitive function at a current mean 
level of 2.9 µg/dL, about 20 years after exposure when blood-lead levels were 40-50 µg/dL (Stokes 1998).  
The negative impact of lead on IQ and other neurobehavioral outcomes persist in most recent studies 
following adjustment for numerous confounding factors including social class, quality of caregiving, and 
parental intelligence. Moreover, these effects appear to persist into adolescence and young adulthood in 
the absence of marked reductions in environmental exposure to lead. (EPA 2006b, p. 6-76). This further 
supports the concern that early exposures to lead may lead to irreversible damage and supports the 
benefits of regulatory interventions to prevent and/or reduce lead exposure. 
5.1 Overview of Removal of Opt-Out Provision in Terms of Benefits Estimation 
Under 40 CFR 745.82(c), the LRRP rule’s training requirements and work practice standards do not apply 
to renovations in target housing when the firm performing the renovation has obtained a statement signed 
by the owner that the renovation will occur in the owner's residence, no child under age 6 resides there, no 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-3    
pregnant woman resides there, the housing is not a child-occupied facility, and the owner acknowledges 
that the renovation firm will not be required to use the work practices contained in EPA's renovation, 
repair, and painting rule.  This is referred to as the “opt-out provision” of the LRRP rule. 
After further consideration of the opt-out provision, the Agency believes it is in the best interest of the 
public to remove the provision.  EPA has decided it is important to require the LRRP work practices in 
target housing even if there is no child under age six or pregnant woman residing there and the housing is 
not a COF.  The 2008 LRRP rule focused mainly on protecting young children and pregnant women from 
lead hazards. Lead exposure adversely affects older children and adults.  Those effects most pertinent to 
adults at levels associated with individual blood lead levels in the range of 10 ug/dL and less include 
hematological, cardiovascular and renal effects.  
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and incidence of 
hypertension. A meta-analysis of numerous studies estimates that a doubling of blood-lead level (e.g., 
from 5 to 10 µg/dL) is associated with ~1.0 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) increase in systolic blood 
pressure and ~0.6 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure.  The evidence for an association of lead with 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is limited but supportive (EPA 2006b, p. E-10). 
The Criteria Document states ‘‘although an increase of a few mmHg in blood pressure might not be of 
concern for an individual’
