EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
This assessment examines the costs and benefits of improving the fuel economy of passenger 
cars and light trucks for model years (MY) 2011- 2015.  It includes a discussion of the 
technologies that can improve fuel economy, analysis of the potential impact on retail prices, 
safety, lifetime fuel savings and their value to consumers, and other societal benefits such as 
improved energy security and reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases1.   
 
In the previous rulemaking, the agency reformed the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) 
standards for light trucks with a size-based standard based on footprint2.  This rulemaking 
continues this approach for both passenger cars and light trucks.  A continuous mathematical 
function provides a separate fuel economy target for each footprint.  Different parameters for the 
continuous mathematical function are derived for each model year.  Individual manufacturers 
will be required to comply with a single fuel economy level that is based on the distribution of its 
production among the footprints of its vehicles in each particular model year.  Although the same 
reformed CAFE scheme is proposed for both passenger cars and light trucks, they are established 
with different continuous mathematical functions specific to their design capabilities.    
 
The agency is proposing the “Optimized (7%)” alternative.  In this alternative the agency uses a 
7 percent discount rate to value benefits and sets the proposed mpg levels where marginal costs 
equal marginal benefits.  It is one of six alternatives examined in the analysis.  We also examined 
a second optimized scenario when discounting benefits at 3 percent “Optimized (3%).  In general 
order of increasing severity (see Table 1), the seven scenarios examined are: 
 
1:  “25% Below Optimized”:   This alternative mirrors the absolute difference in mpg derived 
from the 25% Above Optimized scenario in going the same mpg amount below the Optimized 
7% alternative  
2:  “Optimized (7%) An increase in the standard based upon availability of technologies and a 
marginal cost/benefit analysis, as was used in setting the MY 2008-2011 light truck standard.  
The mpg levels are set using a 7 percent discount rate for benefits.   
3:  “25% Above Optimized”:   This alternative looks at the mpg levels of the Optimized (7%) 
and the Total Cost Equals Total Benefit alternative and picks mpg levels that are 25 percent of 
that difference.   
                                                 
1  This analysis does not contain NHTSA’s assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed 
standards and reasonable alternatives for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 
4321-4347.  On March 28, 2008, NHTSA published a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement 
(EIS) and opened the NEPA scoping process (73 FR 16615).  NHTSA will consider the potential environmental 
impacts of the proposed standards and reasonable alternatives through the NEPA process, and NHTSA’s NEPA 
analysis will inform any further action on the proposed standards, consistent with NEPA and EPCA. 
2  Vehicle Footprint is defined as the wheelbase (the distance from the center of the front axle to the center of the 
rear axle) times the average track width (the distance between the centerline of the tires) of the vehicle (in square 
feet).

4:  “50% Above Optimized”:   This alternative looks at the mpg levels of the Optimized (7%) 
and the Total Cost Equals Total Benefit alternative and picks mpg levels that are 50 percent of 
that difference.   
5:  “Optimized (3%) An increase in the standard based upon availability of technologies and a 
marginal cost/benefit analysis, as was used in setting the MY 2008-2011 light truck standard, 
except that the mpg levels are set using a 3 percent discount rate for benefits.   
6:  “Total Costs Equal Total Benefits”:  An increase in the standard to a point where essentially 
total costs of the technologies added equals total benefits.  In this analysis, for brevity, at times it 
is labeled “TC = TB”.    
7:  “Technology Exhaustion”:  An increase in the standard based upon the maximum usage 
(based on NHTSA’s perspective) of available technologies, disregarding the cost impacts.     
  
Table 1a shows the agency’s projection of the actual harmonic average that would be achieved 
by the manufacturers, assuming those manufacturers whose plans are above the requirements 
would achieve those higher levels.  Table 1b shows the estimated required levels.  All of the 
tables in this analysis compare an adjusted baseline to the achieved harmonic average in Table 
1a.   
    
Costs:  Costs were estimated based on the specific technologies that were applied to improve 
each manufacturer’s fuel economy up to the level required under each alternative.  Table 2  
provides those cost estimates on an average per-vehicle basis, and Table 3 provides those 
estimates on a fleet-wide basis in millions of dollars.  Costs are not discounted. 
 
Benefits:  Benefits are determined mainly
