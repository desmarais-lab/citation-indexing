Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-1 
Executive Summary  
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead, 
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied 
facilities (COFs).  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule changes the LRRP program by requiring 
renovators to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation jobs, and requiring them to re-clean and 
re-test for a second subset of renovation jobs if the tests show that lead dust levels exceed the established 
clearance standards.   
Background 
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.  
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure 
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has 
been found to create lead hazards.  Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint, 
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless 
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed. 
The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) and is codified in 
Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was promulgated under the 
authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  The existing LRRP regulations 
require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for compensation in buildings covered 
by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees are trained as either renovators or 
workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based paint.   
Overview of the LRRP Clearance Rule  
Figure ES-1 provides a summary of the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements of the proposed rule, 
and their relationship with the requirements of the 2008 LRRP rule.  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
would require dust wipe testing on uncarpeted floors and on window sills and troughs after the following 
types of renovations that disturb lead-based paint: removing more than 40 ft2 of trim, molding, cabinets, 
or other fixtures; removing or replacing of window or door frames; scraping 60 ft2 or more of painted 
surfaces; or using a heat gun at temperatures below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit1.  Renovations using 
machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed operation (such as power sanders or abrasive 
blasting), or involving demolition or removal of more than 6 ft2 of plaster walls with lead-based paint 
through destructive means, would require firms to demonstrate – through dust wipe testing – that they 
have met clearance standards before the renovation will be considered complete.  (For interior surfaces, 
the clearance standards are 40 μg/ft2 on floors, 250 μg/ft2 on interior windowsills, and 400 μg/ft2 on 
window troughs.)  If any of the dust wipe test results exceed the interior clearance standards, the firm will 
have to re-clean and re-test the area that failed.  The proposed rule allows renovation firms to stop after 
the second failed clearance test, regardless of the result, if the renovation firm did not agree to refinish the 
surface that is failing clearance as part of the renovation contract.  In such instances, the renovation firm 
would only have to re-clean and test the surface again, no matter what the second dust wipe testing result 
is.  In contrast, the economic analysis assumes that if the second dust wipe testing result fails the 
clearance test, the renovation firm would have to re-clean the surface a second time and test the surface a 
third time.  Therefore, the economic analysis overestimates the cost of the clearance requirement. 
 
                                                     
1 Under the 2008 LRRP rule at 40 CFR 745.85(a)(3)(iii), operating a heat gun on lead-based paint is permitted only at 
temperatures below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit.

lead-based paint through removing trim, molding, cabinets, or other fixtures; removal 
or replacement of window or door frames; scraping painted surfaces; or the use of a 
heat gun. 
 Clearance is required for renovations that disturb lead-based paint through: 
- High-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet; or 
- Plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
 
2. Proposed Rule Threshold Option

a Under the 2008 LRRP rule at 40 CFR 745.85(a)(3)(ii), the use of machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed 
operation such as sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting, is prohibited unless such 
machines are used with HEPA exhaust control. 
 
Number of Events 
The proposed rule would affect approximately 1.6 million renovations per year.  By comparison, the 
LRRP program applies to 18.7 million renovations each year, of which 7.4 million use lead-safe work 
practices (because they test positive for lead-based paint, and are conducted in compliance with the rule).

Table ES-3 indicates the estimated number of renovation events affected by the different options by type 
of renovation and threshold size.  In about 1.5 million renovations (96% of those affected by the proposed 
rule), dust wipe testing would be required without a requirement to achieve clearance.  The most common

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
single event activities covered by the rule are window or door frame removal, followed by trim, molding, 
or cabinet removal.  But the most common regulated activity overall involves multiple regulated activities 
occurring during the course of a single job (e.g., a renovation with both window frame removal and trim 
removal).

 Executive Summary ES-5 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-6 
Renovations requiring clearance make up about 4% of the renovations affected by the proposed rule (and 
1% of all renovations using lead-safe work practices under the LRRP program).  Multiple activity events 
(including combinations of clearance events and dust wipe testing only events) are the most common 
activities requiring clearance, followed by the demolition or removal of plaster through destructive 
means, and using machines that remove paint through high speed operations. 
There are an estimated 1.9 million regulated events per year under the low threshold option and 1.3 
million regulated events per year under the high threshold option.  The distribution of event types under 
these alternate options (in terms of the relative frequency of different single and multiple event activities) 
is similar to the proposed threshold option.  There are an estimated 1.6 million regulated events per year 
under the third party sampling option, the dust wipe testing only option, and the clearance only option, the 
same as under the proposed threshold option. 
Costs of the Proposed Rule  
Dust wipe testing costs are expected to vary according to the number of samples taken, which depend on 
the number of rooms in the work area and whether or not the room is carpeted.  For a typical one-room 
renovation event, four samples would be required (window sill, window trough, workroom floor, and 
adjacent room floor).  For a renovation event where both the renovated room and the adjacent room are 
carpeted, only two samples would be required (window sill and window trough).  Each additional room 
inside the work area will add two to three dust wipes depending on whether or not the room is carpeted 
and whether or not there are windows in the work area.  However samples are not required for more than 
four rooms in a unit’s work area. 
All entities that conduct renovations covered by the proposed Clearance Rule will have to use a trained 
dust sampling technician to take dust samples and have them tested.  (A trained dust sampling technician 
is an individual who has successfully completed a dust sampling technician course accredited by EPA or 
an EPA-authorized State or Tribal program.)  Renovators can either hire a third-party dust sampling 
technician or have themselves or one of their employees trained as a dust sampling technician.  Which 
approach they choose may depend on several factors, including the number of renovations they perform 
each year covered by the proposed rule. 
The average cost for a renovation firm to hire a third-party lead evaluation firm to take the dust wipe 
samples, send them to a lab for testing, and provide a one-page report is estimated to be a fixed cost of 
$158 and a variable cost of $26 per sample.  Thus, the cost to hire a third party to take four dust samples, 
send them to a lab for analysis, and provide a short report is estimated to be $262.  Given that some 
covered renovations take place in more than one room (so that more than four samples may be required, 
depending on whether uncarpeted floors and windows are present), the average cost of the dust testing 
requirement is nearly $300 per job if a third party dust sampling technician is used.  
Firms performing multiple renovations a year where dust wipe testing is required can save money by 
having the renovator or a worker trained as a dust sampling technician.  This requires taking an eight hour 
initial training course (and a four hour refresher course every five years thereafter), at an estimated 
annualized cost of $146 per year.  For renovators that perform multiple covered renovations per year, the 
savings from using their own dust sampling technician are much greater than the annualized cost of the 
dust sampling technician training.  Dust testing for these samples will cost these renovators an average of 
approximately $170 per job (including training costs), a savings of $130 per job compared to using a third 
party dust sampling technician.  The analysis assumes that over 233,000 renovators will choose to 
become trained as dust sampling technicians so that they can collect samples for their own renovations.  
The proposed rule does not require them to become trained, but many renovators may find it more 
economical to do so rather than hiring a third party to take the samples.   
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-7 
The cost of dust wipe testing for a job will vary based on the number of surfaces that must be tested, and 
whether the dust sampling is done in-house or by a third-party firm.  Overall, typical costs are estimated 
to vary from $120 to $340 per job.  A typical renovator will have 3 to 38 jobs per year requiring dust wipe 
sampling, with an average of 7 such jobs per year. 
For clearance events (use of a high-speed paint removal machine or demolition or destructive removal of 
over 6 sq. ft. of plaster), renovators would incur similar dust wipe testing costs, in terms of the cost per 
test.  Re-cleaning and re-sampling are only necessary for a subset of events in which a surface fails the 
first round of clearance testing.  In the event of a failed clearance test, only the component(s) that failed 
the tests must be re-cleaned.  For example, if the window sill sample failed clearance but the window 
troughs and the floors passed, the window sill must be re-cleaned but the window troughs and the floors 
do not need to be re-cleaned.  These re-cleaning costs vary from job to job, depending on the number and 
type of components that failed and the size of the space that must be cleaned.  Overall, re-cleaning costs 
are estimated to vary from $43 to up to $5,172 per job, although the costs for a typical job are expected to 
be at the very low end of the range.  (The high end of the range reflects a COF where 14 rooms are 
renovated and where all floor, sill and trough samples fail two rounds of clearance testing and are re-
cleaned twice.  This is an overestimate, since the rule does not require a second re-cleaning or a third 
round of testing.) 
Table ES-4 summarizes the annualized work practice costs by event type for the three different threshold 
options.  This table does not include training costs for renovators who choose to become trained as a dust 
sampling technician, since the training costs are not specific to individual event types.

Benefits 
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of 
medical observation and scientific research.  Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body 
and is toxic to many organ systems.  As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on 
several organ systems.  A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in 
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them.  Young children (from birth through age five) 
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently 
measured by IQ change).   
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and 
expected earnings.  The estimated value of an IQ point is approximately $13,000, which represents the 
present value of a loss in expected lifetime earnings due to a one point IQ drop.  This estimated value of 
an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as additional 
education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels of lead.   
Investigating associations between lead exposure and behavior, mood, and social conduct of children has 
been an emerging area of research.  Early studies indicated linkages between lower-level lead toxicity and 
behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, attentional problems, and hyperactivity) in children.  Blood-lead 
and tooth-lead levels have been associated with behavioral features of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), including distractibility, poor organization, lack of persistence in completing tasks, and 
daydreaming, in various cohorts of children with a wide range of lead exposures.  The relationship 
between lead exposure and delinquent and criminal behavior also has been addressed in several 
investigations.  Studies linking attention deficits, aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and poor self-
regulation with lead have raised the prospect that early exposure may result in an increased likelihood of 
engaging in antisocial behaviors in later life.  Elevated lead levels have been associated with several 
measures of behavioral disturbance and delinquent behavior. 
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased 
hypertension.   
Both epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead affect 
many different organ systems.  Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are 
among those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or 
possibly lower); and these categories of effects are currently of greatest public health concern.  Other 
newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups are also emerging 
as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern.  It appears that some of these 
effects, particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's

neurobehavioral development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a 
threshold.   
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would require dust wipe testing after many of the renovation, repair, 
and painting (RRP) activities regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule, and would require clearance after a 
smaller subset of RRP activities.  The clearance requirements of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are 
expected to result in lower exposures to dust lead by reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after 
RRP activities.  Two types of benefits are expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing 
requirements.  The first type is the direct benefits of the information to the owners and occupants, which 
includes the value of the information on dust lead levels remaining in the renovation work area.  For 
building owners and occupants, this information is likely to improve their understanding and awareness of 
dust lead hazards.  It will also greatly improve their ability to make further risk management decisions.  
This information is particularly critical where dust lead levels approach or exceed the regulatory hazard 
standards.  The second benefit expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing requirements 
stems from changed behavior on the part of renovation firms.  EPA believes that dust wipe testing results 
will also provide valuable feedback to renovation firms on how well they are cleaning up after 
renovations.  It is likely that the specific dust lead levels contained in dust wipe testing results will 
increase renovation firm cleaning efficiency.  Renovation firms will be incentivized to lower the dust lead 
levels remaining after renovation jobs, even if the levels are at or near the regulatory standards.  Because 
proper cleanup plays such a vital role in the minimization of dust lead hazards created by renovations, 
providing information on dust lead levels remaining after renovations to building owners and occupants 
will serve as an incentive for firms to perform post-renovation cleaning efficiently and thoroughly, 
reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after RRP. 
The proposed rule will protect children and adults residing in target housing and attending a COF from 
exposure to lead dust from renovations in a variety of situations.  It will result in fewer homes being 
purchased with pre-existing lead hazards.  It is common for home owners to perform activities that disturb 
paint before selling a house.  The proposed rule decreases the likelihood of lead hazards being present 
when new occupants move into the home.  And the proposed rule will also benefit individuals visiting a 
friend, relative, or caregiver’s house where a renovation has been performed. 
The number of individuals residing in target housing and attending COFs with renovations affected under 
the different options is shown in Table ES-6.  The proposed rule would protect 8.4 million such 
individuals per year, including 809,000 children under the age of 6 and 96,000 pregnant women.  (This is 
important because the transplacental transfer of lead in humans is well documented, and infants are 
generally born with a lead body burden reflecting that of the mother.)  The estimates are limited to 
residents in target housing and children attending COFs, and do not include other groups such as 
individuals who move into housing after a renovation has been performed, or who visit a friend or 
relative’s house.

Small Entity Impacts 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities 
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments.  The vast majority of entities in the 
industries affected by the proposed rule are small.   
Two factors are evaluated in analyzing the rule’s impacts on small entities, (1) the number of firms that 
would experience the impact, and (2) the size of the impact.  Average annual compliance costs as a 
percentage of average annual revenues are used to assess the potential average impact of the rule on small 
businesses and small governments.  This ratio is a good measure of entities’ ability to afford the costs 
attributable to a regulatory requirement, because comparing compliance costs to revenues provides a 
reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly available measure 
of economic activity.  Where regulatory costs represent a small fraction of a typical entity’s revenues, the 
financial impacts of the regulation on such entities may be considered as not significant.  For non-profit 
organizations, impacts are measured by comparing rule costs to the organization’s annual expenditures.  
When expenditure data were not available, however, revenue information was used as a proxy for 
expenditures.  It is appropriate to calculate the impact ratios using annualized costs, because these costs 
are more representative of the continuing costs entities face to comply with the rule. 
Table ES-7 presents the total number of small governments, non-profit organizations, and small for-profit 
businesses, and the average cost-to-revenue ratios for each category.  It is estimated that a total of 
approximately 203,000 small entities would be affected by the program, including nearly 203,000 small 
businesses with average impacts of 0.5 percent, about 200 small non-profits with average impacts of 0.1 
percent, and over 100 small governments with average impacts of 0.004 percent.  All of the small entity 
impact calculations assume that the small entities absorb all of the rule’s costs, and that none of the costs 
are passed through to their customers.

The cost of the proposed rule to a typical small entity is estimated to average $1,200 per year, but will 
vary depending on the number of renovation, repair, and painting events undertaken by a small entity in 
the industry sector involved.  As shown in Table ES-8, the average cost impact ranges from about 0.004 
percent to 1.1 percent of revenues, depending on the industry sector.

Table ES-9 provides additional information on potential impacts on small residential construction 
establishments.  Some of the small entities subject to the rule have employees while others are non-
employers.  The non-employers typically perform fewer jobs than firms with employees, and thus have 
lower work practice compliance costs.  However, they also have lower average revenues than entities 
with employees, so their impacts (measured as costs divided by revenues) can be higher.  Impact 
estimates for non-employers should be interpreted with caution, as some non-employers may have issues 
related to understatement of income, which would tend to exaggerate the average impact ratio for this 
class of small entities.  As shown in Table ES-9, there are 151,000 non-employer renovation contractors 
estimated to be affected by the removal of the opt-out provision.  The average cost to these contractors is 
estimated to be $700 each.  This represents 0.7% to 2.6% of reported revenues, depending on the industry 
sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 1 1-1 
1. Introduction 
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead, 
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied 
facilities (COFs).  The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) 
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was 
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  Section IV of 
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known 
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.    
The existing LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for 
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees 
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based 
paint.   
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.  
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure 
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has 
been found to create lead hazards.  Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint, 
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless 
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed. 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes the following changes to the LRRP program: (1) a 
requirement to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement to 
perform dust wipe testing and achieve clearance for a second subset of renovation activities where the 
quantity and characteristics of the dust make it hard to clean up.   
1.1 Purpose of the LRRP Rule Revisions 
The LRRP rule requires certification of entities that perform renovation, repair and/or painting in 
buildings covered by the regulations.  This includes construction contractors (including sole practitioners) 
as well as landlords and other building owners (such as school districts) that may perform RRP activities 
using their own staff.  It does not, however, cover renovation, repair and painting (RRP) work performed 
by homeowners on their own homes.  The certified entity must ensure that all persons performing RRP 
activities on behalf of the entity in buildings covered by the rule are either renovators who have received 
formal training in EPA-approved work practices from an EPA-accredited course or workers who have 
received on-the-job training in these approved work practices.  In addition, the rule requires the use of 
these approved work practices to ensure that proper cleanup has occurred.   
The proposed rule will require renovation firms to perform dust wipe testing after certain types of 
renovation activities and to provide copies of the test results to the owners and occupants of the renovated 
buildings.  These requirements will serve to inform the owners and occupants of the remaining post-
renovation lead-dust levels.  In instances when clearance must be achieved, owners and occupants would 
be provided with the information that the renovated areas met lead-dust level standards after cleaning.  
The increased information provided to owners and occupants of renovated buildings will further protect 
individuals (including children under age 6 and pregnant women), who visit, move into, or live adjacent 
to target housing or COFs renovated under the existing LRRP requirements, from exposure to lead 
hazards due to renovation activities. 
1.2 Goal of the Economic Analysis  
The purpose of this report is to analyze various options for the LRRP rulemaking revisions.  The report 
addresses the requirements for economic analysis of Executive Order 12866 – Regulatory Planning and 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 1 1-2 
Review; the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act (SBRFA); Executive Order 12898 – Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
Populations and Low-Income Populations; Executive Order 13045 – Protection of Children from 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks; the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; Executive Order 
12875 – Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership; and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). 
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options.  The three primary options considered in 
this analysis only differ in the size thresholds that trigger the rule’s requirements when performing certain 
renovation activities.   Table 1-1 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they are described in 
more detail below. 
1. Low Threshold Option 
 All event types requiring dust wipe testing where the amount of lead-based paint 
disturbed is larger than 6 square feet.  
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
2. Proposed Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 40 square feet, 
- scraping of paint larger than 60 square feet, 
- heat gun removal of more than 6 square feet 
- Window frame or door frame removal events 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
3. High Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 80 square feet, 
- scraping or heat gun removal of paint larger than 120 square feet, and  
- window frame or door frame removal events. 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 60 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 60 square feet. 
 
There are three alternative options in addition to the three primary options: (1) an option where third party 
dust wipe testing and clearance is required, (2) an option where dust wipe testing is required in lieu of the 
clearance required under the proposed option, (3) an option where clearance is required in lieu of the dust 
wipe testing required
